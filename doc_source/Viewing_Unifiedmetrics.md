# Viewing combined metrics in the Amazon RDS console<a name="Viewing_Unifiedmetrics"></a>

Amazon RDS now provides a consolidated view of Performance Insights and CloudWatch metrics for your DB instance in the Performance Insights dashboard\. You can use the preconfigured dashboard or create a custom dashboard\. The preconfigured dashboard provides the most commonly used metrics to help diagnose performance issues for a database engine\. Alternatively, you can create a custom dashboard with the metrics for a database engine that meet your analysis requirements\. Then, use this dashboard for all the DB instances of that database engine type in your AWS account\. 

You can choose the new monitoring view in the **Monitoring** tab or **Performance Insights** in the navigation pane\. When you navigate to the Performance Insights page, you see the options to choose between the new monitoring view and legacy view\. The option you choose is saved as the default view\.

Performance Insights must be turned on for your DB cluster to view the combined metrics in the Performance Insights dashboard\. For more information about turning on Performance Insights, see [Turning Performance Insights on and off](USER_PerfInsights.Enabling.md)\. 

Currently, the consolidated view of Performance Insights and CloudWatch metrics isn't available in the following AWS Regions: China \(Beijing\), China \(Ningxia\), AWS GovCloud \(US\-East\), and AWS GovCloud \(US\-West\)\.

**Note**  
We recommend that you choose the new monitoring view\. You can continue to use the legacy monitoring view until it is discontinued on December 15, 2023\.
