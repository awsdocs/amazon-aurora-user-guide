# Viewing metrics in the Amazon RDS console<a name="USER_Monitoring"></a>

Amazon RDS integrates with Amazon CloudWatch to display a variety of Aurora DB cluster metrics in the RDS console\. Some metrics are apply at the cluster level, whereas others apply at the instance level\. For descriptions of the instance\-level and cluster\-level metrics, see [Metrics reference for Amazon Aurora](metrics-reference.md)\.

The **Monitoring** tab for your Aurora DB cluster shows the following categories of metrics:
+ **CloudWatch** – Shows the Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Aurora that you can access in the RDS console\. You can also access these metrics in the CloudWatch console\. Each metric includes a graph that shows the metric monitored over a specific time span\. For a list of CloudWatch metrics,  see [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon Aurora](Aurora.AuroraMonitoring.Metrics.md)\.
+ **Enhanced monitoring** – Shows a summary of operating\-system metrics when your Aurora DB cluster has turned on Enhanced Monitoring\. RDS delivers the metrics from Enhanced Monitoring to your Amazon CloudWatch Logs account\. Each OS metric includes a graph showing the metric monitored over a specific time span\. For an overview, see [Monitoring OS metrics with Enhanced Monitoring](USER_Monitoring.OS.md)\. For a list of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, see [OS metrics in Enhanced Monitoring](USER_Monitoring-Available-OS-Metrics.md)\.
+ **OS Process list** – Shows details for each process running in your DB cluster\.
+ **Performance Insights** – Opens the Amazon RDS Performance Insights dashboard for a DB instance in your Aurora DB cluster\. Performance Insights isn't supported at the cluster level\. For an overview of Performance Insights, see [Monitoring DB load with Performance Insights on Amazon Aurora](USER_PerfInsights.md)\. For a list of Performance Insights metrics, see [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Performance Insights](USER_PerfInsights.Cloudwatch.md)\.
