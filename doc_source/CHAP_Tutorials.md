## Tutorials in this guide<a name="CHAP_Tutorials.ThisGuide"></a>

The following tutorials in this guide show you how to perform common tasks with Amazon Aurora:
+ [Tutorial: Create a VPC for use with a DB cluster \(IPv4 only\)](CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateVPC.md)

  Learn how to include a DB cluster in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\) based on the Amazon VPC service\. In this case, the VPC shares data with a web server that is running on an Amazon EC2 instance in the same VPC\.
+ [Tutorial: Create a VPC for use with a DB cluster \(dual\-stack mode\)](CHAP_Tutorials.CreateVPCDualStack.md)

  Learn how to include a DB cluster in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\) based on the Amazon VPC service\. In this case, the VPC shares data with an Amazon EC2 instance in the same VPC\. In this tutorial, you create the VPC for this scenario that works with a database running in dual\-stack mode\. 
+ [Tutorial: Create a web server and an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](TUT_WebAppWithRDS.md)

  Learn how to install an Apache web server with PHP and create a MySQL database\. The web server runs on an Amazon EC2 instance using Amazon Linux, and the MySQL database is an Aurora MySQL DB cluster\. Both the Amazon EC2 instance and the DB cluster run in an Amazon VPC\.
+ [Tutorial: Restore an Amazon Aurora DB cluster from a DB cluster snapshot](tut-restore-cluster.md)

  Learn how to restore a DB cluster from a DB cluster snapshot\.
+ [Tutorial: Use tags to specify which Aurora DB clusters to stop](USER_Tagging.md#Tagging.Aurora.Autostop)

  Learn how to use tags to specify which Aurora DB clusters to stop\.
+ [Tutorial: Log DB instance state changes using Amazon EventBridge](rds-cloud-watch-events.md#log-rds-instance-state)

  Learn how to log a DB instance state change using Amazon EventBridge and AWS Lambda\.

## Tutorials in other AWS guides<a name="CHAP_Tutorials.OtherGuides"></a>

The following tutorials in other AWS guides show you how to perform common tasks with Amazon Aurora:

**Note**  
Some of the tutorials use Amazon RDS DB instances, but they can be adapted to use Aurora DB clusters\.
