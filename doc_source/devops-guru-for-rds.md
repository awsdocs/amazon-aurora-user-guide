## Benefits of DevOps Guru for RDS<a name="devops-guru-for-rds.benefits"></a>

If you're responsible for an Amazon Aurora database, you might not know that an event or regression that is affecting that database is occurring\. When you learn about the issue, you might not know why it's occurring or what to do about it\. Rather than turning to a database administrator \(DBA\) for help or relying on third\-party tools, you can follow recommendations from DevOps Guru for RDS\. 

You gain the following advantages from the detailed analysis of DevOps Guru for RDS:

**Fast diagnosis**  
DevOps Guru for RDS continuously monitors and analyzes database telemetry\. Performance Insights, Enhanced Monitoring, and Amazon CloudWatch collect telemetry data for your database cluster\. DevOps Guru for RDS uses statistical and machine learning techniques to mine this data and detect anomalies\. To learn more about telemetry data, see [Monitoring DB load with Performance Insights on Amazon Aurora](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html) and [Monitoring OS metrics with Enhanced Monitoring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html) in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide* \.

**Fast resolution**  
Each anomaly identifies the performance issue and suggests avenues of investigation or corrective actions\. For example, DevOps Guru for RDS might recommend that you investigate specific wait events\. Or it might recommend that you tune your application pool settings to limit the number of database connections\. Based on these recommendations, you can resolve performance issues more quickly than by troubleshooting manually\.

**Proactive insights**  
DevOps Guru for RDS uses metrics from your resources to detect potentially problematic behavior before it becomes a bigger problem\. For example, it can detect when your database is using an increasing number of on\-disk temporary tables, which could start to impact performance\. DevOps Guru then provides recommendations to help you address issues before they become bigger problems\.

**Deep knowledge of Amazon engineers and machine learning**  
To detect performance issues and help you resolve bottlenecks, DevOps Guru for RDS relies on machine learning \(ML\) and advanced mathematical formulas\. Amazon database engineers contributed to the development of the DevOps Guru for RDS findings, which encapsulate many years of managing hundreds of thousands of databases\. By drawing on this collective knowledge, DevOps Guru for RDS can teach you best practices\.

## How DevOps Guru for RDS works<a name="devops-guru-for-rds.how-it-works"></a>

DevOps Guru for RDS collects data about your Aurora databases from Amazon RDS Performance Insights\. The most important metric is `DBLoad`\. DevOps Guru for RDS consumes the Performance Insights metrics, analyzes them with machine learning, and publishes insights to the dashboard\.

An *insight* is a collection of related anomalies that were detected by DevOps Guru\.

In DevOps Guru for RDS, an *anomaly* is a pattern that deviates from what is considered normal performance for your Amazon Aurora database\. 

### Proactive insights<a name="devops-guru-for-rds.how-it-works.insights.proactive"></a>

A *proactive insight* lets you know about problematic behavior before it occurs\. It contains anomalies with recommendations and related metrics to help you address issues in your Amazon Aurora databases before become bigger problems\. These insights are published in the DevOps Guru dashboard\.

For example, DevOps Guru might detect that your Aurora PostgreSQL database is creating many on\-disk temporary tables\. If not addressed, this trend might lead to performance issues\. Each proactive insight includes recommendations for corrective behavior and links to relevant topics in either [Tuning Aurora MySQL with Amazon DevOps Guru proactive insights](MySQL.Tuning.proactive-insights.md) or [Tuning Aurora PostgreSQL with Amazon DevOps Guru proactive insights](PostgreSQL.Tuning_proactive_insights.md)\. For more information, see [Working with insights in DevOps Guru](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/working-with-insights.html) in the *Amazon DevOps Guru User Guide*\. 

### Reactive insights<a name="devops-guru-for-rds.how-it-works.insights.reactive"></a>

A *reactive insight* identifies anomalous behavior as it occurs\. If DevOps Guru for RDS finds performance issues in your Amazon Aurora DB instances, it publishes a reactive insight in the DevOps Guru dashboard\. For more information, see [Working with insights in DevOps Guru](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/working-with-insights.html) in the *Amazon DevOps Guru User Guide*\.

#### Causal anomalies<a name="devops-guru-for-rds.how-it-works.anomalies.causal"></a>

A *causal anomaly* is a top\-level anomaly within a reactive insight\. **Database load \(DB load\)** is the causal anomaly for DevOps Guru for RDS\. 

An anomaly measures performance impact by assigning a severity level of **High**, **Medium**, or **Low**\. To learn more, see [Key concepts for DevOps Guru for RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/working-with-rds.overview.definitions.html) in the *Amazon DevOps Guru User Guide*\.

If DevOps Guru detects a current anomaly on your DB instance, you're alerted in the **Databases** page of the RDS console\. The console also alerts you to anomalies that occurred in the past 24 hours\. To go to the anomaly page from the RDS console, choose the link in the alert message\. The RDS console also alerts you in the page for your Amazon Aurora DB cluster \.

#### Contextual anomalies<a name="devops-guru-for-rds.how-it-works.anomalies.contextual"></a>

A *contextual anomaly* is a finding within **Database load \(DB load\)** that is related to a reactive insight\. Each contextual anomaly describes a specific Amazon Aurora performance issue that requires investigation\. For example, DevOps Guru for RDS might recommend that you consider increasing CPU capacity or investigate wait events that are contributing to DB load\.

**Important**  
We recommend that you test any changes on a test instance before modifying a production instance\. In this way, you understand the impact of the change\.

To learn more, see [Analyzing anomalies in Amazon RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/working-with-rds.analyzing.html) in the *Amazon DevOps Guru User Guide*\.

#### Adding Aurora resources using AWS CloudFormation<a name="devops-guru-for-rds.configuring.coverage.cfn"></a>

You can use tags to add coverage for your Aurora resources to your CloudFormation templates\. The following procedure assumes that you have a CloudFormation template both for your Aurora DB instance and DevOps Guru stack\.

**To specify an Aurora DB instance using a CloudFormation tag**

1. In the CloudFormation template for your DB instance, define a tag using a key/value pair\.

   The following example assigns the value `my-aurora-db-instance1` to `Devops-guru-cfn-default` for an Aurora DB instance\.

   ```
   MyAuroraDBInstance1:
     Type: "AWS::RDS::DBInstance"
     Properties:
       DBClusterIdentifier: my-aurora-db-cluster
       DBInstanceIdentifier: my-aurora-db-instance1
       Tags:
         - Key: Devops-guru-cfn-default
           Value: devopsguru-my-aurora-db-instance1
   ```

1. In the CloudFormation template for your DevOps Guru stack, specify the same tag in your resource collection filter\.

   The following example configures DevOps Guru to provide coverage for the resource with the tag value `my-aurora-db-instance1`\.

   ```
   DevOpsGuruResourceCollection:
     Type: AWS::DevOpsGuru::ResourceCollection
     Properties:
       ResourceCollectionFilter:
         Tags:
           - AppBoundaryKey: "Devops-guru-cfn-default"
             TagValues:
             - "devopsguru-my-aurora-db-instance1"
   ```

   The following example provides coverage for all resources within the application boundary `Devops-guru-cfn-default`\.

   ```
   DevOpsGuruResourceCollection:
     Type: AWS::DevOpsGuru::ResourceCollection
     Properties:
       ResourceCollectionFilter:
         Tags:
           - AppBoundaryKey: "Devops-guru-cfn-default"
             TagValues:
             - "*"
   ```
