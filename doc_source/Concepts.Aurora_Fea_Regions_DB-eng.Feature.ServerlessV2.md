# Aurora Serverless v2<a name="Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.ServerlessV2"></a>

Aurora Serverless v2 is an on\-demand, auto\-scaling feature designed to be a cost\-effective approach to running intermittent or unpredictable workloads on Amazon Aurora\. It automatically starts up, shuts down, and scales capacity up or down, as needed by your applications\. The scaling is faster and more granular than with Aurora Serverless v1\. With Aurora Serverless v2, each cluster can contain a writer DB instance and multiple reader DB instances\. You can combine Aurora Serverless v2 and traditional provisioned DB instances within the same cluster\. For more information, see [Using Aurora Serverless v2](aurora-serverless-v2.md)\.
