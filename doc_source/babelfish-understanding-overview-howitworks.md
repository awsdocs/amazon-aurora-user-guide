# Understanding Babelfish architecture and configuration<a name="babelfish-understanding-overview-howitworks"></a>

You manage the Aurora PostgreSQL\-Compatible Edition DB cluster running Babelfish much as you would any Aurora DB cluster\. That is, you benefit from the scalability, high\-availability with failover support, and built\-in replication provided by an Aurora DB cluster\. To learn more about these capabilities, see [Managing performance and scaling for Aurora DB clusters](Aurora.Managing.Performance.md), [High availability for Amazon Aurora](Concepts.AuroraHighAvailability.md), and [Replication with Amazon Aurora](Aurora.Replication.md)\. You also have access to many other AWS tools and utilities, including the following:
+ Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides you with data and actionable insights\. For more information, see [Monitoring Amazon Aurora metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](monitoring-cloudwatch.md)\.
+ Performance Insights is a database performance tuning and monitoring feature that helps you quickly assess the load on your database\. To learn more, see [Monitoring DB load with Performance Insights on Amazon Aurora](USER_PerfInsights.md)\.
+ Aurora global databases span multiple AWS Regions, enabling low latency global reads and providing fast recovery from the rare outage that might affect an entire AWS Region\. For more information, see [Using Amazon Aurora global databases](aurora-global-database.md)\.
+ Automatic software patching keeps your database up\-to\-date with the latest security and feature patches when they become available\.
+ Amazon RDS events notify you by email or SMS message of important database events, such as an automated failover\. For more information, see [Monitoring Amazon Aurora events](working-with-events.md)\. 

Following, you can learn about Babelfish architecture and how the SQL Server databases that you migrate are handled by Babelfish\. When you create your Babelfish DB cluster, you need to make some decisions up front about single database or multiple databases, collations, and other details\.
