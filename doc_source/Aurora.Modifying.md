# Modifying an Amazon Aurora DB cluster<a name="Aurora.Modifying"></a>

You can change the settings of a DB cluster to accomplish tasks such as changing its backup retention period or its database port\. You can also modify DB instances in a DB cluster to accomplish tasks such as changing its DB instance class or enabling Performance Insights for it\. This topic guides you through modifying an Aurora DB cluster and its DB instances, and describes the settings for each\. 

We recommend that you test any changes on a test DB cluster or DB instance before modifying a production DB cluster or DB instance, so that you fully understand the impact of each change\. This is especially important when upgrading database versions\. 

## Modifying the DB cluster by using the console, CLI, and API<a name="Aurora.Modifying.Cluster"></a><a name="modify_cluster"></a>

You can modify a DB cluster using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API\.

**Note**  
Most modifications can be applied immediately or during the next scheduled maintenance window\. Some modifications, such as turning on deletion protection and changing the master password, are applied immediatelyâ€”regardless of when you choose to apply them\.  
If you're using SSL endpoints and change the DB cluster identifier, stop and restart the DB cluster to update the SSL endpoints\. For more information, see [Stopping and starting an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](aurora-cluster-stop-start.md)\.

### Console<a name="Aurora.Modifying.Cluster.Console"></a>

**To modify a DB cluster**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then select the DB cluster that you want to modify\. 

1. Choose **Modify**\. The **Modify DB cluster** page appears\.

1. Change any of the settings that you want\. For information about each setting, see [Settings for Amazon Aurora](#Aurora.Modifying.Settings)\. 
**Note**  
 In the AWS Management Console, some instance level changes only apply to the current DB instance, while others apply to the entire DB cluster\. For information about whether a setting applies to the DB instance or the DB cluster, see the scope for the setting in [Settings for Amazon Aurora](#Aurora.Modifying.Settings)\. To change a setting that modifies the entire DB cluster at the instance level in the AWS Management Console, follow the instructions in [Modifying a DB instance in a DB cluster](#Aurora.Modifying.Instance)\. 

1. When all the changes are as you want them, choose **Continue** and check the summary of modifications\. 

1. To apply the changes immediately, select **Apply immediately**\. 

1. On the confirmation page, review your changes\. If they are correct, choose **Modify cluster** to save your changes\. 

   Alternatively, choose **Back** to edit your changes, or choose **Cancel** to cancel your changes\. 

### AWS CLI<a name="Aurora.Modifying.Cluster.CLI"></a>

To modify a DB cluster using the AWS CLI, call the [modify\-db\-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.html) command\. Specify the DB cluster identifier, and the values for the settings that you want to modify\. For information about each setting, see [Settings for Amazon Aurora](#Aurora.Modifying.Settings)\. 

**Note**  
Some settings only apply to DB instances\. To change those settings, follow the instructions in [Modifying a DB instance in a DB cluster](#Aurora.Modifying.Instance)\.

**Example**  
The following command modifies `mydbcluster` by setting the backup retention period to 1 week \(7 days\)\.   
For Linux, macOS, or Unix:  

```
aws rds modify-db-cluster \
    --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster \
    --backup-retention-period 7
```
For Windows:  

```
aws rds modify-db-cluster ^
    --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster ^
    --backup-retention-period 7
```

### RDS API<a name="Aurora.Modifying.Cluster.API"></a>

To modify a DB cluster using the Amazon RDS API, call the [ModifyDBCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBCluster.html) operation\. Specify the DB cluster identifier, and the values for the settings that you want to modify\. For information about each parameter, see [Settings for Amazon Aurora](#Aurora.Modifying.Settings)\.

## Modifying a DB instance in a DB cluster<a name="Aurora.Modifying.Instance"></a><a name="modify_instance"></a>

You can modify a DB instance in a DB cluster using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API\.

When you modify a DB instance, you can apply the changes immediately\. To apply changes immediately, you select the **Apply Immediately** option in the AWS Management Console, you use the `--apply-immediately` parameter when calling the AWS CLI, or you set the `ApplyImmediately` parameter to `true` when using the Amazon RDS API\. 

If you don't choose to apply changes immediately, the changes are deferred until the next maintenance window\. During the next maintenance window, any of these deferred changes are applied\. If you choose to apply changes immediately, your new changes and any previously deferred changes are applied\. 

**Important**  
If any of the deferred modifications require downtime, choosing **Apply immediately** can cause unexpected downtime for the DB instance\. There is no downtime for the other DB instances in the DB cluster\.   
 Modifications that you defer aren't listed in the output of the `describe-pending-maintenance-actions` CLI command\. Maintenance actions only include system upgrades that you schedule for the next maintenance window\. 

### Console<a name="Aurora.Modifying.Instance.Console"></a>

**To modify a DB instance in a DB cluster**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**, and then select the DB instance that you want to modify\. 

1. For **Actions**, choose **Modify**\. The **Modify DB Instance** page appears\.

1. Change any of the settings that you want\. For information about each setting, see [Settings for Amazon Aurora](#Aurora.Modifying.Settings)\. 
**Note**  
Some settings apply to the entire DB cluster and must be changed at the cluster level\. To change those settings, follow the instructions in [Modifying the DB cluster by using the console, CLI, and API](#Aurora.Modifying.Cluster)\.   
 In the AWS Management Console, some instance level changes only apply to the current DB instance, while others apply to the entire DB cluster\. For information about whether a setting applies to the DB instance or the DB cluster, see the scope for the setting in [Settings for Amazon Aurora](#Aurora.Modifying.Settings)\. 

1. When all the changes are as you want them, choose **Continue** and check the summary of modifications\. 

1. To apply the changes immediately, select **Apply immediately**\. 

1. On the confirmation page, review your changes\. If they are correct, choose **Modify DB Instance** to save your changes\. 

   Alternatively, choose **Back** to edit your changes, or choose **Cancel** to cancel your changes\. 

### AWS CLI<a name="Aurora.Modifying.Instance.CLI"></a>

To modify a DB instance in a DB cluster by using the AWS CLI, call the [modify\-db\-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-instance.html) command\. Specify the DB instance identifier, and the values for the settings that you want to modify\. For information about each parameter, see [Settings for Amazon Aurora](#Aurora.Modifying.Settings)\. 

**Note**
