## Aurora MySQL configuration parameters<a name="AuroraMySQL.Reference.ParameterGroups"></a><a name="param_groups"></a>

You manage your Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster in the same way that you manage other Amazon RDS DB instances, by using parameters in a DB parameter group\. Amazon Aurora differs from other DB engines in that you have a DB cluster that contains multiple DB instances\. As a result, some of the parameters that you use to manage your Aurora MySQL DB cluster apply to the entire cluster\. Other parameters apply only to a particular DB instance in the DB cluster\.

To manage cluster\-level parameters, you use DB cluster parameter groups\. To manage instance\-level parameters, you use DB parameter groups\. Each DB instance in an Aurora MySQL DB cluster is compatible with the MySQL database engine\. However, you apply some of the MySQL database engine parameters at the cluster level, and you manage these parameters using DB cluster parameter groups\. You can't find cluster\-level parameters in the DB parameter group for an instance in an Aurora DB cluster\. A list of cluster\-level parameters appears later in this topic\.

You can manage both cluster\-level and instance\-level parameters using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the Amazon RDS API\. You use separate commands for managing cluster\-level parameters and instance\-level parameters\. For example, you can use the [modify\-db\-cluster\-parameter\-group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster-parameter-group.html) CLI command to manage cluster\-level parameters in a DB cluster parameter group\. You can use the [modify\-db\-parameter\-group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-parameter-group.html) CLI command to manage instance\-level parameters in a DB parameter group for a DB instance in a DB cluster\.

You can view both cluster\-level and instance\-level parameters in the console, or by using the CLI or RDS API\. For example, you can use the [describe\-db\-cluster\-parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-cluster-parameters.html) AWS CLI command to view cluster\-level parameters in a DB cluster parameter group\. You can use the [describe\-db\-parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-parameters.html) CLI command to view instance\-level parameters in a DB parameter group for a DB instance in a DB cluster\.

**Note**  
Each [default parameter group](USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.md) contains the default values for all parameters in the parameter group\. If the parameter has "engine default" for this value, see the version\-specific MySQL or PostgreSQL documentation for the actual default value\. 

For more information on DB parameter groups, see [Working with DB parameter groups and DB cluster parameter groups](USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.md)\. For rules and restrictions for Aurora Serverless clusters, see [Parameter groups and Aurora Serverless v1](aurora-serverless.how-it-works.md#aurora-serverless.parameter-groups)\.

### Cluster\-level parameters<a name="AuroraMySQL.Reference.Parameters.Cluster"></a><a name="cluster_params"></a>

The following table shows all of the parameters that apply to the entire Aurora MySQL DB cluster\. 


| Parameter name | Modifiable | Notes | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `aurora_binlog_read_buffer_size`  |  Yes  |   Only affects clusters that use binary log \(binlog\) replication\. For information about binlog replication, see [Replication between Aurora and MySQL or between Aurora and another Aurora DB cluster \(binary log replication\)](AuroraMySQL.Replication.MySQL.md)\.   | 
|  `aurora_binlog_replication_max_yield_seconds`  |  Yes  |   Only affects clusters that use binary log \(binlog\) replication\. For information about binlog replication, see [Replication between Aurora and MySQL or between Aurora and another Aurora DB cluster \(binary log replication\)](AuroraMySQL.Replication.MySQL.md)\.   | 
|  `aurora_binlog_use_large_read_buffer`  |  Yes  |   Only affects clusters that use binary log \(binlog\) replication\. For information about binlog replication, see [Replication between Aurora and MySQL or between Aurora and another Aurora DB cluster \(binary log replication\)](AuroraMySQL.Replication.MySQL.md)\.   | 
|  `aurora_enable_replica_log_compression`  |  Yes  |   For more information, see [Performance considerations for Amazon Aurora MySQL replication](AuroraMySQL.Replication.md#AuroraMySQL.Replication.Performance)\. Doesn't apply to clusters that are part of an Aurora global database\.   |

The following are some common wait events for Aurora MySQL\.

**Note**  
For information about the naming conventions used in MySQL wait events, see [ Performance Schema instrument naming conventions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/performance-schema-instrument-naming.html) in the MySQL documentation\.

**io/file/innodb/innodb\_data\_file**  
In this wait event, there are threads waiting on I/O operations to storage\. This event is more prevalent in I/O intensive workloads\. SQL statements showing a comparatively large proportion of this wait event might be running disk intensive queries\. Or they might be requesting data that can't be satisfied from the InnoDB buffer pool\. To find out, check your query plans and cache hit ratios\. For more information, see [ Buffering and caching](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/buffering-caching.html) in the MySQL documentation\.

**io/file/sql/binlog**  
In this wait event, there is a thread waiting on a binlog file that is being written to disk\.

**io/socket/sql/client\_connection**  
In this wait event, a thread is in the process of handling a new connection\.

**io/table/sql/handler**  
This is a table I/O wait event\. Typically, these types of events can be followed by a nested event such as a file I/O event\. For more information about 'atom' and 'molecule' events in the Performance Schema, see [ Performance Schema atom and molecule events](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/performance-schema-atom-molecule-events.html) in the MySQL documentation\.

**lock/table/sql/handler**  
This wait event is a table lock wait event handler\. For more information about 'atom' and 'molecule' events in the Performance Schema, see [ Performance Schema atom and molecule events](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/performance-schema-atom-molecule-events.html) in the MySQL documentation\.

**synch/cond/mysys/my\_thread\_var::suspend**  
In this wait event, threads are suspended when they are waiting on a condition\. For example, this event occurs when threads are waiting for table level lock\. We recommend that you investigate your workload to see what threads might be acquiring table locks on your DB instance\. For more information about table locking in MySQL, see [Table locking issues](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/table-locking.html) in the MySQL documentation\.

In this wait event, LOCK\_open is being used to protect various objects in the data dictionary\. This wait event indicates that there are threads waiting to acquire these locks\. Typically, this event is caused by data dictionary contention\.

**synch/mutex/sql/LOCK\_table\_cache**  
In this wait event, there are threads waiting to acquire a lock on a table cache instance\. For more information, see [How MySQL opens and closes tables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/table-cache.html) in the MySQL documentation\.

**synch/mutex/sql/LOG**  
In this wait event, there are threads waiting on a log lock\. For example, a thread might wait for a lock to write to the slow query log file\.

**synch/mutex/sql/MYSQL\_BIN\_LOG::LOCK\_commit**  
In this wait event, there is a thread that is waiting to acquire a lock with the intention of committing to the binary log\. Binary logging contention can occur on databases with a very high change rate\. Depending on your version of MySQL, there are certain locks being used to protect the consistency and durability of the binary log\. In RDS for MySQL, binary logs are used for replication and the automated backup process\. In Aurora MySQL, binary logs are not needed for native replication or backups\. They are disabled by default but can be enabled and used for external replication or change data capture\.

## Aurora MySQL isolation levels<a name="AuroraMySQL.Reference.IsolationLevels"></a>

 Following, you can learn how DB instances in an Aurora MySQL cluster implement the database property of isolation\. Doing so helps you understand how the Aurora MySQL default behavior balances between strict consistency and high performance\. You can also decide when to change the default settings based on the characteristics of your workload\. 

### Available isolation levels for writer instances<a name="AuroraMySQL.Reference.IsolationLevels.writer"></a>

 You can use the isolation levels `REPEATABLE READ`, `READ COMMITTED`, `READ UNCOMMITTED`, and `SERIALIZABLE` on the primary instance of an Aurora MySQL single\-master cluster\. You can use the isolation levels `REPEATABLE READ`, `READ COMMITTED`, and `READ UNCOMMITTED` on any DB instance in an Aurora MySQL multi\-master cluster\. These isolation levels work the same in Aurora MySQL as in RDS for MySQL\. 

### REPEATABLE READ isolation level for reader instances<a name="AuroraMySQL.Reference.IsolationLevels.reader"></a>

 By default, Aurora MySQL DB instances configured as read\-only Aurora Replicas always use the `REPEATABLE READ` isolation level\. These DB instances ignore any `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL` statements and continue using the `REPEATABLE READ` isolation level\. 

### READ COMMITTED isolation level for reader instances<a name="AuroraMySQL.Reference.IsolationLevels.relaxed"></a>

 If your application includes a write\-intensive workload on the primary instance and long\-running queries on the Aurora Replicas, you might experience substantial purge lag\. *Purge lag* happens when internal garbage collection is blocked by long\-running queries\. The symptom that you see is a high value for `history list length` in output from the `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` command\. You can monitor this value using the `RollbackSegmentHistoryListLength` metric in CloudWatch\. This condition can reduce the effectiveness of secondary indexes and lead to reduced overall query performance and wasted storage space\. 

 If you experience such issues, you can use an Aurora MySQL session\-level configuration setting, `aurora_read_replica_read_committed`, to use the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level on Aurora Replicas\. Using this setting can help reduce slowdowns and wasted space that can result from performing long\-running queries at the same time as transactions that modify your tables\. 

 We recommend making sure that you understand the specific Aurora MySQL behavior of the `READ COMMITTED` isolation before using this setting\. The Aurora Replica `READ COMMITTED` behavior complies with the ANSI SQL standard\. However, the isolation is less strict than typical MySQL `READ COMMITTED` behavior that you might be familiar with\. Thus, you might see different query results under `READ COMMITTED` on an Aurora MySQL read replica than for the same query under `READ COMMITTED` on the Aurora MySQL primary instance or on RDS for MySQL\. You might use the `aurora_read_replica_read_committed` setting for such use cases as a comprehensive report that scans a very large database\. You might avoid it for short queries with small result sets, where precision and repeatability are important\. 

 The `READ COMMITTED` isolation level isn't available for sessions within a secondary cluster in an Aurora global database that use the write forwarding feature\. For information about write forwarding, see [Using write forwarding in an Amazon Aurora global database](aurora-global-database-write-forwarding.md)\. 

#### Enabling READ COMMITTED for readers<a name="AuroraMySQL.Reference.IsolationLevels.relaxed.enabling"></a>

 To enable the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level for Aurora Replicas, enable the `aurora_read_replica_read_committed` configuration setting\. Enable this setting at the session level while connected a specific Aurora Replica\. To do so, run the following SQL commands\. 

```
set session aurora_read_replica_read_committed = ON;
set session transaction isolation level read committed;
```

 You might enable this configuration setting temporarily to perform interactive ad hoc \(one\-time\) queries\. You might also want to run a reporting or data analysis application that benefits from the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level, while leaving the default unchanged for other applications\. 

 When the `aurora_read_replica_read_committed` setting is enabled, use the `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL` command to specify the isolation level for the appropriate transactions\. 

```
set transaction isolation level read committed;
```

#### Differences in READ COMMITTED behavior on Aurora replicas<a name="AuroraMySQL.Reference.IsolationLevels.relaxed.behavior"></a>

 The `aurora_read_replica_read_committed` setting makes the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level available for an Aurora Replica, with consistency behavior that is optimized for long\-running transactions\. The `READ COMMITTED` isolation level on Aurora Replicas has less strict isolation than on Aurora primary instances or multi\-master instances\. For that reason, enable this setting only on Aurora Replicas where you know that your queries can accept the possibility of certain types of inconsistent results\. 

 Your queries can experience certain kinds of read anomalies when the `aurora_read_replica_read_committed` setting is turned on\. Two kinds of anomalies are especially important to understand and handle in your application code\. A *non\-repeatable read* occurs when another transaction commits while your query is running\. A long\-running query can see different data at the start of the query than it sees at the end\. A *phantom read* occurs when other transactions cause existing rows to be reorganized while your query is running, and one or more rows are read twice by your query\. 

 Your queries might experience inconsistent row counts as a result of phantom reads\. Your queries might also return incomplete or inconsistent results due to non\-repeatable reads\. For example, suppose that a join operation refers to tables that are concurrently modified by SQL statements such as `INSERT` or `DELETE`\. In this case, the join query might read a row from one table but not the corresponding row from another table\. 

 The ANSI SQL standard allows both of these behaviors for the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level\. However, those behaviors are different than the typical MySQL implementation of `READ COMMITTED`\. Thus, before enabling the `aurora_read_replica_read_committed` setting, check any existing SQL code to verify if it operates as expected under the looser consistency model\. 

 Row counts and other results might not be strongly consistent under the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level while this setting is enabled\. Thus, you typically enable the setting only while running analytic queries that aggregate large amounts of data and don't require absolute precision\. If you don't have these kinds of long\-running queries alongside a write\-intensive workload, you probably don't need the `aurora_read_replica_read_committed` setting\. Without the combination of long\-running queries and a write\-intensive workload, you're unlikely to encounter issues with the length of the history list\. 

**Example Queries showing isolation behavior for READ COMMITTED on Aurora replicas**  
 The following example shows how `READ COMMITTED` queries on an Aurora Replica might return non\-repeatable results if transactions modify the associated tables at the same time\. The table `BIG_TABLE` contains 1 million rows before any queries start\. Other data manipulation language \(DML\) statements add, remove, or change rows while the are running\.   
 The queries on the Aurora primary instance under the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level produce predictable results\. However, the overhead of keeping the consistent read view for the lifetime of every long\-running query can lead to expensive garbage collection later\.   
 The queries on the Aurora Replica under the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level are optimized to minimize this garbage collection overhead\. The tradeoff is that the results might vary depending on whether the queries retrieve rows that are added, removed, or reorganized by transactions that commit while the query is running\. The queries are allowed to consider these rows but aren't required to\. For demonstration purposes, the queries check only the number of rows in the table by using the `COUNT(*)` function\.   


|  Time  |  DML statement on Aurora primary instance  |  Query on Aurora primary instance with READ COMMITTED  |  Query on Aurora replica with READ COMMITTED  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  T1  |  INSERT INTO big\_table SELECT \* FROM other\_table LIMIT 1000000; COMMIT;   |  |  | 
|  T2  |  |  Q1: SELECT COUNT\(\*\) FROM big\_table;  |  Q2: SELECT COUNT\(\*\) FROM big\_table;  | 
|  T3  |  INSERT INTO big\_table \(c1, c2\) VALUES \(1, 'one more row'\); COMMIT;   |  |  | 
|  T4  |  |  If Q1 finishes now, result is 1,000,000\.  |  If Q2 finishes now, result is 1,000,000 or 1,000,001\.  | 
|  T5  |  DELETE FROM big\_table LIMIT 2; COMMIT;   |  |  | 
|  T6  |  |  If Q1 finishes now, result is 1,000,000\.  |  If Q2 finishes now, result is 1,000,000 or 1,000,001 or 999,999 or 999,998\.  | 
|  T7  |  UPDATE big\_table SET c2 = CONCAT\(c2,c2,c2\); COMMIT;   |  |  | 
|  T8  |  |  If Q1 finishes now, result is 1,000,000\.  |  If Q2 finishes now, result is 1,000,000 or 1,000,001 or 999,999, or possibly some higher number\.  | 
|  T9  |  |  Q3: SELECT COUNT\(\*\) FROM big\_table;  |  Q4: SELECT COUNT\(\*\) FROM big\_table;  | 
|  T10  |  |  If Q3 finishes now, result is 999,999\.  |  If Q4 finishes now, result is 999,999\.  | 
|  T11  |  |  Q5: SELECT COUNT\(\*\) FROM parent\_table p JOIN child\_table c ON \(p\.id = c\.id\) WHERE p\.id = 1000;  |  Q6: SELECT COUNT\(\*\) FROM parent\_table p JOIN child\_table c ON \(p\.id = c\.id\) WHERE p\.id = 1000;  | 
|  T12  |   INSERT INTO parent\_table \(id, s\) VALUES \(1000, 'hello'\); INSERT INTO child\_table \(id, s\) VALUES \(1000, 'world'\); COMMIT;   |  |  | 
|  T13  |  |  If Q5 finishes now, result is 0\.  |  If Q6 finishes now, result is 0 or 1\.  | 
 If the queries finish quickly, before any other transactions perform DML statements and commit, the results are predictable and the same between the primary instance and the Aurora Replica\.   
 The results for Q1 are highly predictable, because `READ COMMITTED` on the primary instance uses a strong consistency model similar to the `REPEATABLE READ` isolation level\.   
 The results for Q2 might vary depending on what transactions commit while that query is running\. For example, suppose that other transactions perform DML statements and commit while the queries are running\. In this case, the query on the Aurora Replica with the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level might or might not take the changes into account\. The row counts are not predictable in the same way as under the `REPEATABLE READ` isolation level\. They also aren't as predictable as queries running under the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level on the primary instance, or on an RDS for MySQL instance\.   
 The `UPDATE` statement at T7 doesn't actually change the number of rows in the table\. However, by changing the length of a variable\-length column, this statement can cause rows to be reorganized internally\. A long\-running `READ COMMITTED` transaction might see the old version of a row, and later within the same query see the new version of the same row\. The query can also skip both the old and new versions of the row\. Thus, the row count might be different than expected\.   
 The results of Q5 and Q6 might be identical or slightly different\. Query Q6 on the Aurora Replica under `READ COMMITTED` is able to see, but is not required to see, the new rows that are committed while the query is running\. It might also see the row from one table but not from the other table\. If the join query doesn't find a matching row in both tables, it returns a count of zero\. If the query does find both the new rows in `PARENT_TABLE` and `CHILD_TABLE`, the query returns a count of one\. In a long\-running query, the lookups from the joined tables might happen at widely separated times\.   
 These differences in behavior depend on the timing of when transactions are committed and when the queries process the underlying table rows\. Thus, you're most likely to see such differences in report queries that take minutes or hours and that run on Aurora clusters processing OLTP transactions at the same time\. These are the kinds of mixed workloads that benefit the most from the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level on Aurora Replicas\. 

## Aurora MySQL hints<a name="AuroraMySQL.Reference.Hints"></a>

 You can use SQL hints with Aurora MySQL queries to fine\-tune performance\. You can also use hints to prevent execution plans for important queries to change based on unpredictable conditions\. 

**Tip**  
 To verify the effect that a hint has on a query, examine the query plan produced by the `EXPLAIN` statement\. Compare the query plans with and without the hint\. 

 The following hints apply to queries that use the hash join feature\. These hints are available in Aurora MySQL 2\.08 and higher\. 

**HASH\_JOIN, NO\_HASH\_JOIN**  
 Turns on or off the ability of the optimizer to choose whether to use the hash join optimization method for a query\. `HASH_JOIN` enables the optimizer to use hash join if that mechanism is more efficient\. `NO_HASH_JOIN` prevents the optimizer from using hash join for the query\. This hint is available in Aurora MySQL 2\.08 and higher\.   
 The following examples show how to use this hint\.   

```
EXPLAIN SELECT/*+ HASH_JOIN(t2) */ f1, f2
  FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.f1 = t2.f1;

EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ NO_HASH_JOIN(t2) */ f1, f2
  FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.f1 = t2.f1;
```

**HASH\_JOIN\_PROBING, NO\_HASH\_JOIN\_PROBING**  
 In a hash join query, specifies whether or not to use the specified table for the probe side of the join\. The query tests whether column values from the build table exist in the probe table, instead of reading the entire contents of the probe table\. You can use `HASH_JOIN_PROBING` and `HASH_JOIN_BUILDING` to specify how hash join queries are processed without reordering the tables within the query text\. This hint is available in Aurora MySQL 2\.08 and higher\.   
 The following examples show how to use this hint\. Specifying the `HASH_JOIN_PROBING` hint for the table `T2` has the same effect as specifying `NO_HASH_JOIN_PROBING` for the table `T1`\.   

```
EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ HASH_JOIN(t2) HASH_JOIN_PROBING(t2) */ f1, f2
  FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.f1 = t2.f1;

EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ HASH_JOIN(t2) NO_HASH_JOIN_PROBING(t1) */ f1, f2
  FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.f1 = t2.f1;
```

**HASH\_JOIN\_BUILDING, NO\_HASH\_JOIN\_BUILDING**  
 In a hash join query, specifies whether or not to use the specified table for the build side of the join\. The query processes all the rows from this table to build the list of column values to cross\-reference with the other table\. You can use `HASH_JOIN_PROBING` and `HASH_JOIN_BUILDING` to specify how hash join queries are processed without reordering the tables within the query text\. This hint is available in Aurora MySQL 2\.08 and higher\.   
 The following examples show how to use this hint\. Specifying the `HASH_JOIN_BUILDING` hint for the table `T2` has the same effect as specifying `NO_HASH_JOIN_BUILDING` for the table `T1`\.   

```
EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ HASH_JOIN(t2) HASH_JOIN_BUILDING(t2) */ f1, f2
  FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.f1 = t2.f1;

EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ HASH_JOIN(t2) NO_HASH_JOIN_BUILDING(t1) */ f1, f2
  FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.f1 = t2.f1;
```

**JOIN\_FIXED\_ORDER**  
 Specifies that tables in the query are joined based on the order they are listed in the query\. It is especially useful with queries involving three or more tables\. It is intended as a replacement for the MySQL `STRAIGHT_JOIN` hint\. Equivalent to the MySQL [JOIN\_FIXED\_ORDER](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimizer-hints.html) hint\. This hint is available in Aurora MySQL 2\.08 and higher\.   
 The following examples show how to use this hint\.   

```
EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ JOIN_FIXED_ORDER */ f1, f2
  FROM t1 JOIN t2 USING (id) JOIN t3 USING (id) JOIN t4 USING (id);
```

**JOIN\_ORDER**  
 Specifies the join order for the tables in the query\. It is especially useful with queries involving three or more tables\. Equivalent to the MySQL [JOIN\_ORDER](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimizer-hints.html) hint\. This hint is available in Aurora MySQL 2\.08 and higher\.   
 The following examples show how to use this hint\.   

```
EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ JOIN_ORDER (t4, t2, t1, t3) */ f1, f2
  FROM t1 JOIN t2 USING (id) JOIN t3 USING (id) JOIN t4 USING (id);
```

**JOIN\_PREFIX**  
 Specifies the tables to put first in the join order\. It is especially useful with queries involving three or more tables\. Equivalent to the MySQL [JOIN\_PREFIX](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimizer-hints.html) hint\. This hint is available in Aurora MySQL 2\.08 and higher\.   
 The following examples show how to use this hint\.   

```
EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ JOIN_ORDER (t4, t2) */ f1, f2
  FROM t1 JOIN t2 USING (id) JOIN t3 USING (id) JOIN t4 USING (id);
```

**JOIN\_SUFFIX**  
 Specifies the tables to put last in the join order\. It is especially useful with queries involving three or more tables\. Equivalent to the MySQL [JOIN\_SUFFIX](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimizer-hints.html) hint\. This hint is available in Aurora MySQL 2\.08 and higher\.   
 The following examples show how to use this hint\.   

```
EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ JOIN_ORDER (t1, t3) */ f1, f2
  FROM t1 JOIN t2 USING (id) JOIN t3 USING (id) JOIN t4 USING (id);
```

## Aurora MySQL stored procedures<a name="AuroraMySQL.Reference.StoredProcs"></a>

You can call the following stored procedures while connected to the primary instance in an Aurora MySQL cluster\. These procedures control how transactions are replicated from an external database into Aurora MySQL, or from Aurora MySQL to an external database\. To learn how to use replication based on global transaction identifiers \(GTIDs\) with Aurora MySQL, see [Using GTID\-based replication for Aurora MySQL](mysql-replication-gtid.md)\.

### mysql\.rds\_set\_master\_auto\_position<a name="mysql_rds_set_master_auto_position"></a>

Sets the replication mode to be based on either binary log file positions or on global transaction identifiers \(GTIDs\)\.

#### Syntax<a name="mysql_rds_set_master_auto_position-syntax"></a>

```
CALL mysql.rds_set_master_auto_position (auto_position_mode);
```

#### Parameters<a name="mysql_rds_set_master_auto_position-parameters"></a>

 *auto\_position\_mode*   
A value that indicates whether to use log file position replication or GTID\-based replication:  
+ `0` – Use the replication method based on binary log file position\. The default is `0`\.
+ `1` – Use the GTID\-based replication method\.

#### Usage notes<a name="mysql_rds_set_master_auto_position-usage-notes"></a>

 For an Aurora MySQL DB cluster, you call this stored procedure while connected to the primary instance\. 

The master user must run the `mysql.rds_set_master_auto_position` procedure\.

For Aurora, this procedure is supported for Aurora MySQL version 2\.04 and later MySQL 5\.7–compatible versions\. GTID\-based replication isn't supported for Aurora MySQL 1\.1 or 1\.0\.

### mysql\.rds\_set\_external\_master\_with\_auto\_position<a name="mysql_rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position"></a>

Configures an Aurora MySQL primary instance to accept incoming replication from an external MySQL instance\. This procedure also configures replication based on global transaction identifiers \(GTIDs\)\.

 This procedure is available for both RDS for MySQL and Aurora MySQL\. It works differently depending on the context\. When used with Aurora MySQL, this procedure doesn't configure delayed replication\. This limitation is because RDS for MySQL supports delayed replication but Aurora MySQL doesn't\. 

#### Syntax<a name="mysql_rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position-syntax"></a>

```
CALL mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position (
  host_name
  , host_port
  , replication_user_name
  , replication_user_password
  , ssl_encryption
);
```

#### Parameters<a name="mysql_rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position-parameters"></a>

 *host\_name*   
The host name or IP address of the MySQL instance running external to Aurora to become the replication master\.

 *host\_port*   
The port used by the MySQL instance running external to Aurora to be configured as the replication master\. If your network configuration includes Secure Shell \(SSH\) port replication that converts the port number, specify the port number that is exposed by SSH\.

 *replication\_user\_name*   
The ID of a user with `REPLICATION CLIENT` and `REPLICATION SLAVE` permissions on the MySQL instance running external to Aurora\. We recommend that you provide an account that is used solely for replication with the external instance\.

 *replication\_user\_password*   
The password of the user ID specified in `replication_user_name`\.

 *ssl\_encryption*   
This option is not currently implemented\.  The default is 0\.

#### Usage notes<a name="mysql_rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position-usage-notes"></a>

 For an Aurora MySQL DB cluster, you call this stored procedure while connected to the primary instance\. 

The master user must run the `mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position` procedure\. The master user runs this procedure on the primary instance of an Aurora MySQL DB cluster that acts as a replication target\. This can be the replication target of an external MySQL DB instance or an Aurora MySQL DB cluster\.

For Aurora, this procedure is supported for Aurora MySQL version 2\.04 and later MySQL 5\.7\-compatible versions\. GTID\-based replication isn't supported for Aurora MySQL 1\.1 or 1\.0\.

Before you run `mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position`, configure the external MySQL DB instance to be a replication master\. To connect to the external MySQL instance, specify values for `replication_user_name` and `replication_user_password`\. These values must indicate a replication user that has `REPLICATION CLIENT` and `REPLICATION SLAVE` permissions on the external MySQL instance\. 

**To configure an external MySQL instance as a replication master**

1. Using the MySQL client of your choice, connect to the external MySQL instance and create a user account to be used for replication\. The following is an example\.

   ```
   CREATE USER 'repl_user'@'mydomain.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'SomePassW0rd'
   ```

1. On the external MySQL instance, grant `REPLICATION CLIENT` and `REPLICATION SLAVE` privileges to your replication user\. The following example grants `REPLICATION CLIENT` and `REPLICATION SLAVE` privileges on all databases for the `'repl_user'` user for your domain\.

   ```
   GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT, REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repl_user'@'mydomain.com'
   IDENTIFIED BY 'SomePassW0rd'
   ```

When you call `mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position`, Amazon RDS records certain information\. This information is the time, the user, and an action of `"set master"` in the `mysql.rds_history` and `mysql.rds_replication_status` tables\.

To skip a specific GTID\-based transaction that is known to cause a problem, you can use the [mysql\.rds\_skip\_transaction\_with\_gtid](#mysql_rds_skip_transaction_with_gtid) stored procedure\. For more information about working with GTID\-based replication, see [Using GTID\-based replication for Aurora MySQL](mysql-replication-gtid.md)\.

#### Examples<a name="mysql_rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position-examples"></a>

When run on an Aurora primary instance, the following example configures the Aurora cluster to act as a read replica of an instance of MySQL running external to Aurora\.

```
call mysql.rds_set_external_master_with_auto_position(
  'Externaldb.some.com',
  3306,
  'repl_user'@'mydomain.com',
  'SomePassW0rd');
```

### mysql\.rds\_skip\_transaction\_with\_gtid<a name="mysql_rds_skip_transaction_with_gtid"></a>

Skips replication of a transaction with the specified global transaction identifier \(GTID\) on an Aurora primary instance\.

You can use this procedure for disaster recovery when a specific GTID transaction is known to cause a problem\. Use this stored procedure to skip the problematic transaction\. Examples of problematic transactions include transactions that disable replication, delete important data, or cause the DB instance to become unavailable\.

#### Syntax<a name="mysql_rds_skip_transaction_with_gtid-syntax"></a>

```
CALL mysql.rds_skip_transaction_with_gtid (gtid_to_skip);
```

#### Parameters<a name="mysql_rds_skip_transaction_with_gtid-parameters"></a>

 *gtid\_to\_skip*   
The GTID of the replication transaction to skip\.

#### Usage notes<a name="mysql_rds_skip_transaction_with_gtid-usage-notes"></a>

 For an Aurora MySQL DB cluster, you call this stored procedure while connected to the primary instance\. 

The master user must run the `mysql.rds_skip_transaction_with_gtid` procedure\.

For Aurora, this procedure is supported for Aurora MySQL version 2\.04 and later MySQL 5\.7\-compatible versions\. GTID\-based replication isn't supported for Aurora MySQL 1\.1 or 1\.0\.
