# Aurora PostgreSQL long\-term support \(LTS\) releases<a name="AuroraPostgreSQL.Updates.LTS"></a>

 Each new Aurora PostgreSQL version remains available for a certain amount of time for you to use when you create or upgrade a DB cluster\. After this period, you must upgrade any clusters that use that version\. You can manually upgrade your cluster before the support period ends, or Aurora can automatically upgrade it for you when its Aurora PostgreSQL version is no longer supported\. 

 Aurora designates certain Aurora PostgreSQL versions as long\-term support \(LTS\) releases\. Database clusters that use LTS releases can stay on the same version longer and undergo fewer upgrade cycles than clusters that use non\-LTS releases\. LTS minor versions include only bug fixes \(through patch versions\); an LTS version doesn't include new features released after its introduction\. 

 Once a year, DB clusters running on an LTS minor version are patched to the latest patch version of the LTS release\. We do this patching to help ensure that you benefit from cumulative security and stability fixes\. We might patch an LTS minor version more frequently if there are critical fixes, such as for security, that need to be applied\. 

**Note**  
To remain on an LTS minor version for the duration of its lifecycle, make sure to turn off **Auto minor version upgrade** for your DB instances\. To avoid automatically upgrading your DB cluster from the LTS minor version, set **Auto minor version upgrade** to **No** on all DB instances in your Aurora cluster\. 

 We recommend that you upgrade to the latest release, instead of using the LTS release, for most of your Aurora PostgreSQL clusters\. Doing so takes advantage of Aurora as a managed service and gives you access to the latest features and bug fixes\. LTS releases are intended for clusters with the following characteristics: 
+  You can't afford downtime on your Aurora PostgreSQL application for upgrades outside of rare occurrences for critical patches\. 
+  The testing cycle for the cluster and associated applications takes a long time for each update to the Aurora PostgreSQL database engine\. 
+  The database version for your Aurora PostgreSQL cluster has all the DB engine features and bug fixes that your application needs\.
