## Cluster\-level metrics for Amazon Aurora<a name="Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Monitoring.Metrics.clusters"></a>

The following table describes metrics that are specific to Aurora clusters\.


**Amazon Aurora cluster\-level metrics**  

| Metric | Console name | Description | Applies to | Units | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  `AuroraGlobalDBDataTransferBytes`  |  **Aurora Global DB Data Transfer Bytes \(Bytes\)**  |  In an Aurora Global Database, the amount of redo log data transferred from the master AWS Region to a secondary AWS Region\.  |  Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL  |  Bytes  | 
|  `AuroraGlobalDBProgressLag`  |    |  In an Aurora Global Database, the measure of how far the secondary cluster is behind the primary cluster for both user transactions and system transactions\.  |  Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL  |  Milliseconds  | 
|  `AuroraGlobalDBReplicatedWriteIO`  |  **Aurora Global DB Replicated Write IO**  |  In an Aurora Global Database, the number of write I/O operations replicated from the primary AWS Region to the cluster volume in a secondary AWS Region\. The billing calculations for the secondary AWS Regions in a global database use `VolumeWriteIOPs` to account for writes performed within the cluster\. The billing calculations for the primary AWS Region in a global database use `VolumeWriteIOPs` to account for the write activity within that cluster, and `AuroraGlobalDBReplicatedWriteIO` to account for cross\-Region replication within the global database\.  |  Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL  |  Count  | 
|  `AuroraGlobalDBReplicationLag`  |  **Aurora Global DB Replication Lag \(Milliseconds\)**  |  For an Aurora Global Database, the amount of lag when replicating updates from the primary AWS Region\.  |  Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL  |  Milliseconds  | 
|  `AuroraGlobalDBRPOLag`  |    |  In an Aurora Global Database, the recovery point objective \(RPO\) lag time\. This metric measures how far the secondary cluster is behind the primary cluster for user transactions\.  |  Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL  |  Milliseconds  | 
|  `AuroraVolumeBytesLeftTotal`  |    |  The remaining available space for the cluster volume\. As the cluster volume grows, this value decreases\. If it reaches zero, the cluster reports an out\-of\-space error\. If you want to detect whether your Aurora MySQL cluster is approaching the size limit of 128 tebibytes \(TiB\), this value is simpler and more reliable to monitor than `VolumeBytesUsed`\. `AuroraVolumeBytesLeftTotal` takes into account storage used for internal housekeeping and other allocations that don't affect your storage billing\.  |  Aurora MySQL  |  Bytes  | 
|  `BacktrackChangeRecordsCreationRate`  |  **Backtrack Change Records Creation Rate \(Count\)**  |  The number of backtrack change records created over 5 minutes for your DB cluster\.  |  Aurora MySQL  |  Count per 5 minutes  | 
|  `BacktrackChangeRecordsStored`  |  **Backtrack Change Records Stored \(Count\)**  |  The number of backtrack change records used by your DB cluster\.  |  Aurora MySQL  |  Count  | 
|  `BackupRetentionPeriodStorageUsed`  |  **Backup Retention Period Storage Used \(GiB\)**  |  The total amount of backup storage used to support the point\-in\-time restore feature within the Aurora DB cluster's backup retention window\. This amount is included in the total reported by the `TotalBackupStorageBilled` metric\. It is computed separately for each Aurora cluster\. For instructions, see [Understanding Amazon Aurora backup storage usage](aurora-storage-backup.md)\.   |  Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL  |  Bytes  | 
|  `ServerlessDatabaseCapacity`  |    |  The current capacity of an Aurora Serverless DB cluster\.  |  Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL  |  Count  | 
|  `SnapshotStorageUsed`  |  **Snapshot Storage Used \(GiB\)**  |  The total amount of backup storage consumed by all Aurora snapshots for an Aurora DB cluster outside its backup retention window\. This amount is included in the total reported by the `TotalBackupStorageBilled` metric\. It is computed separately for each Aurora cluster\. For instructions, see [Understanding Amazon Aurora backup storage usage](aurora-storage-backup.md)\.   |  Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL  |  Bytes  | 
|  `TotalBackupStorageBilled`  |  **Total Backup Storage Used \(GiB\)**  |  The total amount of backup storage in bytes for which you are billed for a given Aurora DB cluster\. The metric includes the backup storage measured by the `BackupRetentionPeriodStorageUsed` and `SnapshotStorageUsed` metrics\. This metric is computed separately for each Aurora cluster\. For instructions, see [Understanding Amazon Aurora backup storage usage](aurora-storage-backup.md)\.   |  Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL  |  Bytes  | 
|  `VolumeBytesUsed`  |  **Volume Bytes Used \(GiB\)**  |  The amount of storage used by your Aurora DB instance\. This value affects the cost of the Aurora DB cluster \(for pricing information, see the [Amazon RDS product page](http://aws.amazon.com/rds/#pricing)\)\.  This value doesn't reflect some internal storage allocations that don't affect storage billing\. For Aurora MySQL you can anticipate out\-of\-space issues more accurately by testing whether `AuroraVolumeBytesLeftTotal` is approaching zero instead of comparing `VolumeBytesUsed` against the storage limit of 128 TiB\.  |  Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL  |  Bytes  | 
|  `VolumeReadIOPs`  |  **Volume Read IOPS \(Count\)**  |  The number of billed read I/O operations from a cluster volume within a 5\-minute interval\. Billed read operations are calculated at the cluster volume level, aggregated from all instances in the Aurora DB cluster, and then reported at 5\-minute intervals\. The value is calculated by taking the value of the **Read operations** metric over a 5\-minute period\. You can determine the amount of billed read operations per second by taking the value of the **Billed read operations** metric and dividing by 300 seconds\. For example, if the **Billed read operations** returns 13,686, then the billed read operations per second is 45 \(13,686 / 300 = 45\.62\)\.  You accrue billed read operations for queries that request database pages that aren't in the buffer cache and must be loaded from storage\. You might see spikes in billed read operations as query results are read from storage and then loaded into the buffer cache\.   If your Aurora MySQL cluster uses parallel query, you might see an increase in `VolumeReadIOPS` values\. Parallel queries don't use the buffer pool\. Thus, although the queries are fast, this optimized processing can result in an increase in read operations and associated charges\.    |  Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL  |  Count per 5 minutes  | 
|  `VolumeWriteIOPs`  |  **Volume Write IOPS \(Count\)**  |  The number of write disk I/O operations to the cluster volume, reported at 5\-minute intervals\. For a detailed description of how billed write operations are calculated, see `VolumeReadIOPs`\.  |  Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL  |  Count per 5 minutes  |
