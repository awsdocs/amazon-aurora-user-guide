# Getting started with Aurora Serverless v2<a name="aurora-serverless-v2.upgrade"></a>

 To convert an existing database to use Aurora Serverless v2, you can do the following: 
+  Upgrade from a provisioned Aurora cluster\. 
+  Upgrade from an Aurora Serverless v1 cluster\. 
+  Perform a dump and restore from an Aurora Serverless v2 \(preview\) cluster\. 
+ Migrate from an on\-premises database to an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster\.

 When your upgraded cluster is running the appropriate engine version as listed in [Requirements for Aurora Serverless v2](aurora-serverless-v2.requirements.md), you can begin adding Aurora Serverless v2 DB instances to it\. The first DB instance that you add to the upgraded cluster must be a provisioned DB instance\. Then you can switch over the processing for the write workload, the read workload, or both to the Aurora Serverless v2 DB instances\.

## Upgrading or switching existing clusters to use Aurora Serverless v2<a name="aurora-serverless-v2.getting-started-general-procedure"></a>

 If your provisioned cluster has an engine version that supports Aurora Serverless v2, switching to Aurora Serverless v2 doesn't require an upgrade\. In that case, you can add Aurora Serverless v2 DB instances to your original cluster\. You can switch the cluster to use all Aurora Serverless v2 DB instances\. You can also use a combination of Aurora Serverless v2 and provisioned DB instances in the same DB cluster\. For the Aurora engine versions that support Aurora Serverless v2, see [Aurora Serverless v2](Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.ServerlessV2.md)\. 

 If you're running a lower engine version that doesn't support Aurora Serverless v2, you take these general steps: 

1.  Upgrade the cluster\. 

1.  Create a provisioned writer DB instance for the upgraded cluster\. 

1.  Modify the cluster to use Aurora Serverless v2 DB instances\. 

 Such an upgrade might involve one or more snapshot restore operations\. When doing an upgrade across multiple major engine versions, you perform an intermediate upgrade for every major version between the original and final clusters\. 

**Important**  
 When you perform a major version upgrade to an Aurora Serverless v2\-compatible version by using snapshot restore or cloning, the first DB instance that you add to the new cluster must be a provisioned DB instance\. This addition starts the final stage of the upgrade process\.   
 Until that final stage happens, the cluster doesn't have the infrastructure that's required for Aurora Serverless v2 support\. Thus, these upgraded clusters always start with a provisioned writer DB instance\. Then you can convert or fail over the provisioned DB instance to an Aurora Serverless v2 one\. 

 Upgrading from Aurora Serverless v1 to Aurora Serverless v2 involves creating a provisioned cluster as an intermediate step\. Then you perform the same upgrade steps as when you start with a provisioned cluster\. 

 Switching from Aurora Serverless v2 \(preview\) to Aurora Serverless v2 involves a logical dump and restore\.

## Switching from a provisioned cluster to Aurora Serverless v2<a name="aurora-serverless-v2.switch-from-provisioned"></a>

 To switch a provisioned cluster to use Aurora Serverless v2, follow these steps: 

1.  Check if the provisioned cluster needs to be upgraded to be used with Aurora Serverless v2 DB instances\. For the Aurora versions that are compatible with Aurora Serverless v2, see [Requirements for Aurora Serverless v2](aurora-serverless-v2.requirements.md)\. 

    If the provisioned cluster is running an engine version that isn't available for Aurora Serverless v2, upgrade the engine version of the cluster: 
   +  If you have a MySQL 5\.6–compatible or MySQL 5\.7–compatible provisioned cluster, follow the upgrade instructions for Aurora MySQL version 3\. Use the procedures in [Upgrading to Aurora MySQL version 3](AuroraMySQL.mysql80-upgrade-procedure.md)\. 
   +  If you have a PostgreSQL\-compatible provisioned cluster running PostgreSQL version 10 through 12, follow the upgrade instructions for Aurora PostgreSQL version 13\. Use the procedures in [How to perform a major version upgrade](USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.md#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL.MajorVersion)\. 

1.  Configure any other cluster properties to match the Aurora Serverless v2 requirements from [Requirements for Aurora Serverless v2](aurora-serverless-v2.requirements.md)\. 

1.  Configure the scaling configuration for the cluster\. Follow the procedure in [Setting the Aurora Serverless v2 capacity range for a cluster](aurora-serverless-v2-administration.md#aurora-serverless-v2-setting-acus)\. 

1.  Add one or more Aurora Serverless v2 DB instances to the cluster\. Follow the general procedure in [Adding Aurora Replicas to a DB cluster](aurora-replicas-adding.md)\. For each new DB instance, specify the special DB instance class name **Serverless** in the AWS Management Console, or `db.serverless` in the AWS CLI or Amazon RDS API\. 

    In some cases, you might already have one or more provisioned reader DB instances in the cluster\. If so, you can convert one of the readers to an Aurora Serverless v2 DB instance instead of creating a new DB instance\. To do so, follow the procedure in [Converting a provisioned writer or reader to Aurora Serverless v2](aurora-serverless-v2-administration.md#aurora-serverless-v2-converting-from-provisioned)\. 

1.  Perform a failover operation to make one of the Aurora Serverless v2 DB instances the writer DB instance for the cluster\.  

1.  \(Optional\) Convert any provisioned DB instances to Aurora Serverless v2, or remove them from the cluster\. Follow the general procedure in [Converting a provisioned writer or reader to Aurora Serverless v2](aurora-serverless-v2-administration.md#aurora-serverless-v2-converting-from-provisioned) or [Deleting a DB instance from an Aurora DB cluster](USER_DeleteCluster.md#USER_DeleteInstance)\. 
**Tip**  
 Removing the provisioned DB instances isn't mandatory\. You can set up a cluster containing both Aurora Serverless v2 and provisioned DB instances\. However, until you are familiar with the performance and scaling characteristics of Aurora Serverless v2 DB instances, we recommend that you configure your clusters with DB instances all of the same type\. 

 The following AWS CLI example shows the switchover process using a provisioned cluster that's running Aurora MySQL version 3\.02\.0\. The cluster is named `mysql-80`\. The cluster starts with two provisioned DB instances named `provisioned-instance-1` and `provisioned-instance-2`, a writer and a reader\. They both use the `db.r6g.large` DB instance class\. 

```
$ aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier mysql-80 \
  --query '*[].[DBClusterIdentifier,DBClusterMembers[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,IsClusterWriter]]' --output text
mysql-80
provisioned-instance-2     False
provisioned-instance-1     True

$ aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier provisioned-instance-1 \
  --output text --query '*[].[DBInstanceIdentifier,DBInstanceClass]'
provisioned-instance-1     db.r6g.large

$ aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier provisioned-instance-2 \
  --output text --query '*[].[DBInstanceIdentifier,DBInstanceClass]'
provisioned-instance-2     db.r6g.large
```

 We create a table with some data\. That way, we can confirm that the data and operation of the cluster are the same before and after the switchover\. 

```
mysql> create database serverless_v2_demo;
mysql> create table serverless_v2_demo.demo (s varchar(128));
mysql> insert into serverless_v2_demo.demo values ('This cluster started with a provisioned writer.');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
```

 First, we add a capacity range to the cluster\. Otherwise, we get an error when adding any Aurora Serverless v2 DB instances to the cluster\. If we use the AWS Management Console for this procedure, that step is automatic when we add the first Aurora Serverless v2 DB instance\. 

```
$ aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier serverless-v2-instance-1 \
  --db-cluster-identifier mysql-80 --db-instance-class db.serverless --engine aurora-mysql

An error occurred (InvalidDBClusterStateFault) when calling the CreateDBInstance operation:
Set the Serverless v2 scaling configuration on the parent DB cluster before creating a Serverless v2 DB instance.

$ # The blank ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration attribute confirms that the cluster doesn't have a capacity range set yet.
$ aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier mysql-80 --query 'DBClusters[*].ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration'
[]

$ aws rds modify-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier mysql-80 \
  --serverless-v2-scaling-configuration MinCapacity=0.5,MaxCapacity=16
{
  "DBClusterIdentifier": "mysql-80",
  "ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration": {
    "MinCapacity": 0.5,
    "MaxCapacity": 16
  }
}
```

 We create two Aurora Serverless v2 readers to take the place of the original DB instances\. We do so by specifying the `db.serverless` DB instance class for the new DB instances\. 

```
$ aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier serverless-v2-instance-1 --db-cluster-identifier mysql-80 --db-instance-class db.serverless --engine aurora-mysql
{
  "DBInstanceIdentifier": "serverless-v2-instance-1",
  "DBClusterIdentifier": "mysql-80",
  "DBInstanceClass": "db.serverless",
  "DBInstanceStatus": "creating"
}

$ aws rds create-db-instance --db-instance-identifier serverless-v2-instance-2 \
  --db-cluster-identifier mysql-80 --db-instance-class db.serverless --engine aurora-mysql
{
  "DBInstanceIdentifier": "serverless-v2-instance-2",
  "DBClusterIdentifier": "mysql-80",
  "DBInstanceClass": "db.serverless",
  "DBInstanceStatus": "creating"
}

$ # Wait for both DB instances to finish being created before proceeding.
$ aws rds wait db-instance-available --db-instance-identifier serverless-v2-instance-1 && \
  aws rds wait db-instance-available --db-instance-identifier serverless-v2-instance-2
```

 We perform a failover to make one of the Aurora Serverless v2 DB instances the new writer for the cluster\. 

```
$ aws rds failover-db-cluster --db-cluster-identifier mysql-80 \
  --target-db-instance-identifier serverless-v2-instance-1
{
  "DBClusterIdentifier": "mysql-80",
  "DBClusterMembers": [
    {
      "DBInstanceIdentifier": "serverless-v2-instance-1",
      "IsClusterWriter": false,
      "DBClusterParameterGroupStatus": "in-sync",
      "PromotionTier": 1
    },
    {
      "DBInstanceIdentifier": "serverless-v2-instance-2",
      "IsClusterWriter": false,
      "DBClusterParameterGroupStatus": "in-sync",
      "PromotionTier": 1
    },
    {
      "DBInstanceIdentifier": "provisioned-instance-2",
      "IsClusterWriter": false,
      "DBClusterParameterGroupStatus": "in-sync",
      "PromotionTier": 1
    },
    {
      "DBInstanceIdentifier": "provisioned-instance-1",
      "IsClusterWriter": true,
      "DBClusterParameterGroupStatus": "in-sync",
      "PromotionTier": 1
    }
  ],
  "Status": "available"
}
```

 It takes a few seconds for that change to take effect\. At that point, we have an Aurora Serverless v2 writer and an Aurora Serverless v2 reader\. Thus, we don't need either of the original provisioned DB instances\. 

```
$ aws rds describe-db-clusters --db-cluster-identifier mysql-80 \
  --query '*[].[DBClusterIdentifier,DBClusterMembers[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,IsClusterWriter]]' \
  --output text
mysql-80
serverless-v2-instance-1        True
serverless-v2-instance-2        False
provisioned-instance-2          False
provisioned-instance-1          False
```

 The last step in the switchover procedure is to delete both of the provisioned DB instances\. 

```
$ aws rds delete-db-instance --db-instance-identifier provisioned-instance-2 --skip-final-snapshot
{
  "DBInstanceIdentifier": "provisioned-instance-2",
  "DBInstanceStatus": "deleting",
  "Engine": "aurora-mysql",
  "EngineVersion": "8.0.mysql_aurora.3.02.0",
  "DBInstanceClass": "db.r6g.large"
}

$ aws rds delete-db-instance --db-instance-identifier provisioned-instance-1 --skip-final-snapshot
{
  "DBInstanceIdentifier": "provisioned-instance-1",
  "DBInstanceStatus": "deleting",
  "Engine": "aurora-mysql",
  "EngineVersion": "8.0.mysql_aurora.3.02.0",
  "DBInstanceClass": "db.r6g.large"
}
```

 As a final check, we confirm that the original table is accessible and writeable from the Aurora Serverless v2 writer DB instance\. 

```
mysql> select * from serverless_v2_demo.demo;
+---------------------------------------------------+
| s                                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| This cluster started with a provisioned writer.   |
+---------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> insert into serverless_v2_demo.demo values ('And it finished with a Serverless v2 writer.');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> select * from serverless_v2_demo.demo;
+---------------------------------------------------+
| s                                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| This cluster started with a provisioned writer.   |
| And it finished with a Serverless v2 writer.      |
+---------------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

 We also connect to the Aurora Serverless v2 reader DB instance and confirm that the newly written data is available there too\. 

```
mysql> select * from serverless_v2_demo.demo;
+---------------------------------------------------+
| s                                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| This cluster started with a provisioned writer.   |
| And it finished with a Serverless v2 writer.      |
+---------------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

#### Comparison of Aurora Serverless v2 and Aurora Serverless v1 requirements<a name="aurora-serverless.comparison-requirements"></a>

The following table summarizes the different requirements to run your database using Aurora Serverless v2 or Aurora Serverless v1\. Aurora Serverless v2 offers higher versions of the Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL DB engines than Aurora Serverless v1 does\.


| Feature | Aurora Serverless v2 requirement | Aurora Serverless v1 requirement | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  DB engines  |  Aurora MySQL, Aurora PostgreSQL  |  Aurora MySQL, Aurora PostgreSQL  | 
|  Supported Aurora MySQL versions  | See [Aurora Serverless v2 with Aurora MySQL](Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.ServerlessV2.md#Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.ServerlessV2.amy)\. | See [Aurora Serverless v1 with Aurora MySQL](Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.ServerlessV1.md#Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.ServerlessV1.amy)\. |

| Upgrading a DB cluster |  Similarly to provisioned DB clusters, you can perform upgrades manually without waiting for Aurora to upgrade the DB cluster for you\. For more information, see [Modifying an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](Aurora.Modifying.md)\.  To perform a major version upgrade from 13\.x to 14\.x for an Aurora PostgreSQL–compatible DB cluster, the maximum capacity of your cluster must be at least 2 ACUs\.   |  Minor version upgrades are applied automatically as they become available\. For more information, see [Aurora Serverless v1 and Aurora database engine versions](aurora-serverless.relnotes.md)\. You can perform major version upgrades manually\. For more information, see [Modifying an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster](aurora-serverless.modifying.md)\.  | 
| Converting from provisioned DB cluster |  You can use the following methods: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.upgrade.html)  |  Restore snapshot of provisioned cluster to create new Aurora Serverless v1 cluster\.  |

|  Public IP address allowed?  |  Yes  |  No  | 
|  Virtual private cloud \(VPC\) required?  | Yes |  Yes\. Each Aurora Serverless v1 cluster consumes 2 interface and Gateway Load Balancer endpoints allocated to your VPC\.  | 

#### Comparison of Aurora Serverless v2 and Aurora Serverless v1 scaling and availability<a name="aurora-serverless.comparison-scaling"></a>

 The following table summarizes differences between Aurora Serverless v2 and Aurora Serverless v1 for scalability and availability\. 

 Aurora Serverless v2 scaling is more responsive, more granular, and less disruptive than the scaling in Aurora Serverless v1\. Aurora Serverless v2 can scale both by changing the size of the DB instance and by adding more DB instances to the DB cluster\. It can also scale by adding clusters in other AWS Regions to an Aurora global database\. In contrast, Aurora Serverless v1 only scales by increasing or decreasing the capacity of the writer\. All the compute for an Aurora Serverless v1 cluster runs in a single Availability Zone and a single AWS Region\. 


|  Feature  |  Aurora Serverless v2 scaling and high availability behavior  |  Aurora Serverless v1 scaling and high availability behavior  | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  Minimum Aurora capacity units \(ACUs\) \(Aurora MySQL\)  |  0\.5  |  1 when the cluster is running, 0 when the cluster is paused\.  | 
|  Minimum ACUs \(Aurora PostgreSQL\)  |  0\.5  |  2 when the cluster is running, 0 when the cluster is paused\.  | 
|  Maximum ACUs \(Aurora MySQL\)  |  128  |  256  | 
|  Maximum ACUs \(Aurora PostgreSQL\)  |  128  |  384  | 
|  Stopping a cluster  |  You can manually stop and start the cluster by using [the same cluster stop and start feature](aurora-cluster-stop-start.md) as provisioned clusters\.  |  The cluster pauses automatically after a timeout\. It takes some time to become available when activity resumes\.  | 
|  Scaling for DB instances  |  Scale up and down with minimum increment of 0\.5 ACUs  |  Scale up and down by doubling or halving the ACUs  | 
|  Number of DB instances  |  Same as a provisioned cluster: 1 writer DB instance, up to 15 reader DB instances\.  |  1 DB instance handling both reads and writes\.  | 
|  Scaling can happen while SQL statements are running?  |  Yes\. Aurora Serverless v2 doesn't require waiting for a quiet point\.  |  No\. For example, scaling waits for completion of long\-running transactions, temporary tables, and table locks\.  | 
|  Reader DB instances scale along with writer  |  Optional\.  |  Not applicable\.  | 
|  Maximum storage  |  128 TiB  |  128 TiB or 64 TiB, depending on database engine and version\.  | 
|  Buffer cache preserved when scaling  |  Yes\. Buffer cache is resized dynamically\.  |  No\. Buffer cache is rewarmed after scaling\.  | 
|  Failover  |  Yes, same as for provisioned clusters\.  |  Best effort only, subject to capacity availability\. Slower than in Aurora Serverless v2\.  | 
|  Multi\-AZ capability  |  Yes, same as for provisioned\. A Multi\-AZ cluster requires a reader DB instance in a second Availability Zone \(AZ\)\. For a Multi\-AZ cluster, Aurora performs Multi\-AZ failover in case of an AZ failure\.  |  Aurora Serverless v1 clusters run all their compute in a single AZ\. Recovery in case of AZ failure is best effort only and subject to capacity availability\.  | 
|  Aurora global databases  |  Yes  |  No  | 
|  Scaling based on memory pressure  |  Yes  |  No  | 
|  Scaling based on CPU load  |  Yes  |  Yes  | 
|  Scaling based on network traffic  |  Yes, based on memory and CPU overhead of network traffic\. The max\_connections parameter remains constant to avoid dropping connections when scaling down\.  |  Yes, based on number of connections\.  | 
|  Timeout action for scaling events  |  No  |  Yes  | 
|  Adding new DB instances to cluster through AWS Auto Scaling  |  Not applicable\. You can create Aurora Serverless v2 reader DB instances in promotion tiers 2–15 and leave them scaled down to low capacity\.  |  No\. Reader DB instances aren't available\.  |

### Adapting Aurora Serverless v1 use cases to Aurora Serverless v2<a name="aurora-serverless.comparison-approaches"></a>

 Depending on your use case for Aurora Serverless v1, you might adapt that approach to take advantage of Aurora Serverless v2 features as follows\. 

 Suppose that you have an Aurora Serverless v1 cluster that is lightly loaded and your priority is maintaining continuous availability while minimizing costs\. With Aurora Serverless v2, you can configure a smaller minimum ACU setting of 0\.5, compared with a minimum of 1 ACU for Aurora Serverless v1\. You can increase availability by creating a Multi\-AZ configuration, with the reader DB instance also having a minimum of 0\.5 ACUs\. 

 Suppose that you have an Aurora Serverless v1 cluster that you use in a development and test scenario\. In this case, cost is also a high priority but the cluster doesn't need to be available at all times\. Currently, Aurora Serverless v2 doesn't automatically pause when the cluster is completely idle\. Instead, you can manually stop the cluster when it's not needed, and start it when it's time for the next test or development cycle\. 

 Suppose that you have an Aurora Serverless v1 cluster with a heavy workload\. An equivalent cluster using Aurora Serverless v2 can scale with more granularity\. For example, Aurora Serverless v1 scales by doubling the capacity, for example from 64 to 128 ACUs\. In contrast, your Aurora Serverless v2 DB instance can scale to a value somewhere between those numbers\. 

 Suppose that your workload requires a higher total capacity than is available in Aurora Serverless v1\. You can use multiple Aurora Serverless v2 reader DB instances to offload the read\-intensive parts of the workload from the writer DB instance\. You can also divide the read\-intensive workload among multiple reader DB instances\. 

 For a write\-intensive workload, you might configure the cluster with a large provisioned DB instance as the writer\. You might do so alongside one or more Aurora Serverless v2 reader DB instances\. 

### Upgrading from an Aurora Serverless v1 cluster to Aurora Serverless v2<a name="aurora-serverless-v2.upgrade-from-serverless-v1-procedure"></a>

The process of upgrading a DB cluster from Aurora Serverless v1 to Aurora Serverless v2 involves several steps\. That's because Aurora Serverless v1 isn't available for the same major Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL versions as Aurora Serverless v2 is\. Thus, going from Aurora Serverless v1 to Aurora Serverless v2 always involves at least one major version upgrade\.

## Upgrading from Aurora Serverless v2 \(preview\) to Aurora Serverless v2<a name="aurora-serverless-v2.upgrade-from-serverless-v2-preview"></a>

 Any Aurora MySQL clusters that you created using the Aurora Serverless v2 preview can't be upgraded using the snapshot restore mechanism\. The preview is intended for testing only\. Your preview clusters shouldn't contain any production or business\-critical data\. If you need to bring any data from an Aurora Serverless v2 preview cluster to Aurora Serverless v2, perform a logical dump and restore\. Use the `mysqldump` command as described in [Migrating from MySQL to Amazon Aurora by using mysqldump](AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.md#AuroraMySQL.Migrating.ExtMySQL.mysqldump)\. 

## Migrating from an on\-premises database to Aurora Serverless v2<a name="aurora-serverless-v2.migrate-from-on-prem"></a>

You can migrate your on\-premises databases to Aurora Serverless v2, just as with provisioned Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL\.
+ For MySQL databases, you can use the `mysqldump` command\. For more information, see [Importing data to a MySQL or MariaDB DB instance with reduced downtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Procedural.Importing.NonRDSRepl.html)\.
+ For PostgreSQL databases, you can use the `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` commands\. For more information, see the blog post [Best practices for migrating PostgreSQL databases to Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/best-practices-for-migrating-postgresql-databases-to-amazon-rds-and-amazon-aurora/)\.
