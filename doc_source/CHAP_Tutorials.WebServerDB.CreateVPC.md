# Tutorial: Create a VPC for use with a DB cluster \(IPv4 only\)<a name="CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateVPC"></a>

A common scenario includes a DB cluster in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\) based on the Amazon VPC service\. This VPC shares data with a web server that is running in the same VPC\. In this tutorial, you create the VPC for this scenario\.

The following diagram shows this scenario\. For information about other scenarios, see [Scenarios for accessing a DB cluster in a VPC](USER_VPC.Scenarios.md)\. 

![\[Single VPC scenario\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/con-VPC-sec-grp-aurora.png)

Your DB cluster needs to be available only to your web server, and not to the public internet\. Thus, you create a VPC with both public and private subnets\. The web server is hosted in the public subnet, so that it can reach the public internet\. The DB cluster is hosted in a private subnet\. The web server can connect to the DB cluster because it is hosted within the same VPC\. But the DB cluster isn't available to the public internet, providing greater security\.

This tutorial configures an additional public and private subnet in a separate Availability Zone\. These subnets aren't used by the tutorial\. An RDS DB subnet group requires a subnet in at least two Availability Zones\. The additional subnet makes it easier to configure more than one Aurora DB instance\.

This tutorial describes configuring a VPC for Amazon Aurora DB clusters\. For a tutorial that shows you how to create a web server for this VPC scenario, see [Tutorial: Create a web server and an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](TUT_WebAppWithRDS.md)\. For more information about Amazon VPC, see [Amazon VPC Getting Started Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/GettingStartedGuide/) and [Amazon VPC User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/)\. 

**Tip**  
You can set up network connectivity between an Amazon EC2 instance and a DB cluster automatically when you create the DB cluster\. The network configuration is similar to the one described in this tutorial\. For more information, see [Configure automatic network connectivity with an EC2 instance](Aurora.CreateInstance.md#Aurora.CreateInstance.Prerequisites.VPC.Automatic)\.

## Create a VPC with private and public subnets<a name="CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateVPC.VPCAndSubnets"></a>

Use the following procedure to create a VPC with both public and private subnets\. 

**To create a VPC and subnets**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. In the top\-right corner of the AWS Management Console, choose the Region to create your VPC in\. This example uses the US West \(Oregon\) Region\.

1. In the upper\-left corner, choose **VPC dashboard**\. To begin creating a VPC, choose **Create VPC**\.

1. For **Resources to create** under **VPC settings**, choose **VPC and more**\.

1. For the **VPC settings**, set these values:
   + **Name tag auto\-generation** – **tutorial**
   + **IPv4 CIDR block** – **10\.0\.0\.0/16**
   + **IPv6 CIDR block** – **No IPv6 CIDR block**
   + **Tenancy** – **Default**
   + **Number of Availability Zones \(AZs\)** – **2**
   + **Customize AZs** – Keep the default values\.
   + **Number of public subnet** – **2**
   + **Number of private subnets** – **2**
   + **Customize subnets CIDR blocks** – Keep the default values\.
   + **NAT gateways \($\)** – **None**
   + **VPC endpoints** – **None**
   + **DNS options** – Keep the default values\.

1. Choose **Create VPC**\.

## Create a VPC security group for a public web server<a name="CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateVPC.SecurityGroupEC2"></a>

Next, you create a security group for public access\. To connect to public EC2 instances in your VPC, you add inbound rules to your VPC security group\. These allow traffic to connect from the internet\.

**To create a VPC security group**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. Choose **VPC Dashboard**, choose **Security Groups**, and then choose **Create security group**\. 

1. On the **Create security group** page, set these values: 
   + **Security group name:** **tutorial\-securitygroup**
   + **Description:** **Tutorial Security Group**
   + **VPC:** Choose the VPC that you created earlier, for example: **vpc\-*identifier* \(tutorial\-vpc\)** 

1. Add inbound rules to the security group\.

   1. Determine the IP address to use to connect to EC2 instances in your VPC using Secure Shell \(SSH\)\. To determine your public IP address, in a different browser window or tab, you can use the service at [https://checkip\.amazonaws\.com](https://checkip.amazonaws.com)\. An example of an IP address is `203.0.113.25/32`\.

      In many cases, you might connect through an internet service provider \(ISP\) or from behind your firewall without a static IP address\. If so, find the range of IP addresses used by client computers\.
**Warning**  
If you use `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH access, you make it possible for all IP addresses to access your public instances using SSH\. This approach is acceptable for a short time in a test environment, but it's unsafe for production environments\. In production, authorize only a specific IP address or range of addresses to access your instances using SSH\.

   1. In the **Inbound rules** section, choose **Add rule**\.

   1. Set the following values for your new inbound rule to allow SSH access to your Amazon EC2 instance\. If you do this, you can connect to your Amazon EC2 instance to install the web server and other utilities\. You also connect to your EC2 instance to upload content for your web server\. 
      + **Type:** **SSH**
      + **Source:** The IP address or range from Step a, for example: **203\.0\.113\.25/32**\.

   1. Choose **Add rule**\.

   1. Set the following values for your new inbound rule to allow HTTP access to your web server:
      + **Type:** **HTTP**
      + **Source:** **0\.0\.0\.0/0**

1. Choose **Create security group** to create the security group\.

   Note the security group ID because you need it later in this tutorial\.

## Create a VPC security group for a private DB cluster<a name="CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateVPC.SecurityGroupDB"></a>

To keep your DB cluster private, create a second security group for private access\. To connect to private DB clustersin your VPC, you add inbound rules to your VPC security group that allow traffic from your web server only\.

**To create a VPC security group**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

1. Choose **VPC Dashboard**, choose **Security Groups**, and then choose **Create security group**\.

1. On the **Create security group** page, set these values:
   + **Security group name:** **tutorial\-db\-securitygroup**
   + **Description:** **Tutorial DB Instance Security Group**
   + **VPC:** Choose the VPC that you created earlier, for example: **vpc\-*identifier* \(tutorial\-vpc\)**

1. Add inbound rules to the security group\.

   1. In the **Inbound rules** section, choose **Add rule**\.

   1. Set the following values for your new inbound rule to allow MySQL traffic on port 3306 from your Amazon EC2 instance\. If you do this, you can connect from your web server to your DB cluster\. By doing so, you can store and retrieve data from your web application to your database\. 
      + **Type:** **MySQL/Aurora**
      + **Source:** The identifier of the **tutorial\-securitygroup** security group that you created previously in this tutorial, for example: **sg\-9edd5cfb**\.

1. Choose **Create security group** to create the security group\.

## Create a DB subnet group<a name="CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateVPC.DBSubnetGroup"></a>

A *DB subnet group* is a collection of subnets that you create in a VPC and that you then designate for your DB clusters\. A DB subnet group makes it possible for you to specify a particular VPC when creating DB clusters\.

**To create a DB subnet group**

1. Identify the private subnets for your database in the VPC\.

   1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)\.

   1. Choose **VPC Dashboard**, and then choose **Subnets**\.

   1. Note the subnet IDs of the subnets named **tutorial\-subnet\-private1\-us\-west\-2a** and **tutorial\-subnet\-private2\-us\-west\-2b**\.

      You need the subnet IDs when you create your DB subnet group\.

1. Open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

   Make sure that you connect to the Amazon RDS console, not to the Amazon VPC console\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Subnet groups**\.

1. Choose **Create DB subnet group**\.

1. On the **Create DB subnet group** page, set these values in **Subnet group details**:
   + **Name:** **tutorial\-db\-subnet\-group**
   + **Description:** **Tutorial DB Subnet Group**
   + **VPC:** **tutorial\-vpc \(vpc\-*identifier*\)** 

1. In the **Add subnets** section, choose the **Availability Zones** and **Subnets**\.

   For this tutorial, choose **us\-west\-2a** and **us\-west\-2b** for the **Availability Zones**\. For **Subnets**, choose the private subnets you identified in the previous step\.

1. Choose **Create**\. 

   Your new DB subnet group appears in the DB subnet groups list on the RDS console\. You can choose the DB subnet group to see details in the details pane at the bottom of the window\. These details include all of the subnets associated with the group\.

**Note**  
If you created this VPC to complete [Tutorial: Create a web server and an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](TUT_WebAppWithRDS.md), create the DB cluster by following the instructions in [Create an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateDBCluster.md)\.

## Deleting the VPC<a name="CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateVPC.Delete"></a>
