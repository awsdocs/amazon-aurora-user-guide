# Aurora global databases<a name="Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.GlobalDatabase"></a>

An *Aurora global database* is a single database that spans multiple AWS Regions, enabling low\-latency global reads and disaster recovery from any Region\-wide outage\. It provides built\-in fault tolerance for your deployment because the DB instance relies not on a single AWS Region, but upon multiple Regions and different Availability Zones\.  For more information, see [Using Amazon Aurora global databases](aurora-global-database.md)\.
