# Backtracking an Aurora DB cluster<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack"></a>

With Amazon Aurora MySQL\-Compatible Edition, you can backtrack a DB cluster to a specific time, without restoring data from a backup\.

## Overview of backtracking<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Overview"></a>

Backtracking "rewinds" the DB cluster to the time you specify\. Backtracking is not a replacement for backing up your DB cluster so that you can restore it to a point in time\. However, backtracking provides the following advantages over traditional backup and restore:
+ You can easily undo mistakes\. If you mistakenly perform a destructive action, such as a DELETE without a WHERE clause, you can backtrack the DB cluster to a time before the destructive action with minimal interruption of service\.
+ You can backtrack a DB cluster quickly\. Restoring a DB cluster to a point in time launches a new DB cluster and restores it from backup data or a DB cluster snapshot, which can take hours\. Backtracking a DB cluster doesn't require a new DB cluster and rewinds the DB cluster in minutes\.
+ You can explore earlier data changes\. You can repeatedly backtrack a DB cluster back and forth in time to help determine when a particular data change occurred\. For example, you can backtrack a DB cluster three hours and then backtrack forward in time one hour\. In this case, the backtrack time is two hours before the original time\.

**Note**  
For information about restoring a DB cluster to a point in time, see [Overview of backing up and restoring an Aurora DB cluster](Aurora.Managing.Backups.md)\.

### Backtrack window<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Overview.BacktrackWindow"></a>

With backtracking, there is a target backtrack window and an actual backtrack window:
+ The *target backtrack window* is the amount of time you want to be able to backtrack your DB cluster\. When you enable backtracking, you specify a *target backtrack window*\. For example, you might specify a target backtrack window of 24 hours if you want to be able to backtrack the DB cluster one day\.
+ The *actual backtrack window* is the actual amount of time you can backtrack your DB cluster, which can be smaller than the target backtrack window\. The actual backtrack window is based on your workload and the storage available for storing information about database changes, called *change records\.*

As you make updates to your Aurora DB cluster with backtracking enabled, you generate change records\. Aurora retains change records for the target backtrack window, and you pay an hourly rate for storing them\. Both the target backtrack window and the workload on your DB cluster determine the number of change records you store\. The workload is the number of changes you make to your DB cluster in a given amount of time\. If your workload is heavy, you store more change records in your backtrack window than you do if your workload is light\.

You can think of your target backtrack window as the goal for the maximum amount of time you want to be able to backtrack your DB cluster\. In most cases, you can backtrack the maximum amount of time that you specified\. However, in some cases, the DB cluster can't store enough change records to backtrack the maximum amount of time, and your actual backtrack window is smaller than your target\. Typically, the actual backtrack window is smaller than the target when you have extremely heavy workload on your DB cluster\. When your actual backtrack window is smaller than your target, we send you a notification\.

When backtracking is enabled for a DB cluster, and you delete a table stored in the DB cluster, Aurora keeps that table in the backtrack change records\. It does this so that you can revert back to a time before you deleted the table\. If you don't have enough space in your backtrack window to store the table, the table might be removed from the backtrack change records eventually\.

### Backtracking time<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Overview.BacktrackTime"></a>

Aurora always backtracks to a time that is consistent for the DB cluster\. Doing so eliminates the possibility of uncommitted transactions when the backtrack is complete\. When you specify a time for a backtrack, Aurora automatically chooses the nearest possible consistent time\. This approach means that the completed backtrack might not exactly match the time you specify, but you can determine the exact time for a backtrack by using the [describe\-db\-cluster\-backtracks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-cluster-backtracks.html) AWS CLI command\. For more information, see [Retrieving existing backtracks](#AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Retrieving)\.

### Backtracking limitations<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Limitations"></a>

The following limitations apply to backtracking:
+ Backtracking an Aurora DB cluster is available in certain AWS Regions and for specific Aurora MySQL versions only\. For more information, see [Backtracking in Aurora](Concepts.AuroraFeaturesRegionsDBEngines.grids.md#Concepts.Aurora_Fea_Regions_DB-eng.Feature.Backtrack)\. 
+ Backtracking is only available for DB clusters that were created with the Backtrack feature enabled\. You can enable the Backtrack feature when you create a new DB cluster or restore a snapshot of a DB cluster\. For DB clusters that were created with the Backtrack feature disabled, you can create a clone DB cluster with the Backtrack feature enabled\. Currently, you can't perform backtracking on DB clusters that were created with the Backtrack feature disabled\.
+ The limit for a backtrack window is 72 hours\.
+ Backtracking affects the entire DB cluster\. For example, you can't selectively backtrack a single table or a single data update\.
+ Backtracking isn't supported with binary log \(binlog\) replication\. Cross\-Region replication must be disabled before you can configure or use backtracking\.
+ You can't backtrack a database clone to a time before that database clone was created\. However, you can use the original database to backtrack to a time before the clone was created\. For more information about database cloning, see [Cloning a volume for an Aurora DB cluster](Aurora.Managing.Clone.md)\.
+ Backtracking causes a brief DB instance disruption\. You must stop or pause your applications before starting a backtrack operation to ensure that there are no new read or write requests\. During the backtrack operation, Aurora pauses the database, closes any open connections, and drops any uncommitted reads and writes\. It then waits for the backtrack operation to complete\.
+ Backtracking isn't supported for the following AWS Regions:
  + Africa \(Cape Town\)
  +  China \(Ningxia\) 
  +  Asia Pacific \(Hong Kong\) 
  + Europe \(Milan\)
  +  Europe \(Stockholm\) 
  +  Middle East \(Bahrain\) 
  +  South America \(SÃ£o Paulo\) 
+  You can't restore a cross\-Region snapshot of a backtrack\-enabled cluster in an AWS Region that doesn't support backtracking\. 
+  You can't use Backtrack with Aurora multi\-master clusters\. 
+  If you perform an in\-place upgrade for a backtrack\-enabled cluster from Aurora MySQL version 1 to version 2, you can't backtrack to a point in time before the upgrade happened\. 

## Upgrade considerations for backtrack\-enabled clusters<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Upgrade"></a>

 Backtracking is available for Aurora MySQL 1\.\*, which is compatible with MySQL 5\.6\. It's also available for Aurora MySQL 2\.06 and higher, which is compatible with MySQL 5\.7\. Because of the Aurora MySQL 2\.\* version requirement, if you created the Aurora MySQL 1\.\* cluster with the Backtrack setting enabled, you can only upgrade to a Backtrack\-compatible version of Aurora MySQL 2\.\*\. This requirement affects the following types of upgrade paths: 
+  You can only restore a snapshot of the Aurora MySQL 1\.\* DB cluster to a Backtrack\-compatible version of Aurora MySQL 2\.\*\. 
+  You can only perform point\-in\-time recovery on the Aurora MySQL 1\.\* DB cluster to restore it to a Backtrack\-compatible version of Aurora MySQL 2\.\*\. 

 These upgrade requirements still apply even if you turn off Backtrack for the Aurora MySQL 1\.\* cluster\. 

## Configuring backtracking<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Configuring"></a>

To use the Backtrack feature, you must enable backtracking and specify a target backtrack window\. Otherwise, backtracking is disabled\.

For the target backtrack window, specify the amount of time that you want to be able to rewind your database using Backtrack\. Aurora tries to retain enough change records to support that window of time\.

### Console<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Configuring.Console"></a>

You can use the console to configure backtracking when you create a new DB cluster\. You can also modify a DB cluster to change the backtrack window for a backtrack\-enabled cluster\. If you turn off backtracking entirely for a cluster by setting the backtrack window to 0, you can't enable backtrack again for that cluster\.

#### Configuring backtracking with the console when creating a DB cluster<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Configuring.Console.Creating"></a>

When you create a new Aurora MySQL DB cluster, backtracking is configured when you choose **Enable Backtrack** and specify a **Target Backtrack window** value that is greater than zero in the **Backtrack** section\.

To create a DB cluster, follow the instructions in [Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](Aurora.CreateInstance.md)\. The following image shows the **Backtrack** section\.

![\[Enable Backtrack during DB cluster creation with console\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-backtrack-create.png)

When you create a new DB cluster, Aurora has no data for the DB cluster's workload\. So it can't estimate a cost specifically for the new DB cluster\. Instead, the console presents a typical user cost for the specified target backtrack window based on a typical workload\. The typical cost is meant to provide a general reference for the cost of the Backtrack feature\.

**Important**  
Your actual cost might not match the typical cost, because your actual cost is based on your DB cluster's workload\.

#### Configuring backtrack with the console when modifying a DB cluster<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Configuring.Console.Modifying"></a>

You can modify backtracking for a DB cluster using the console\.

**Note**  
Currently, you can modify backtracking only for a DB cluster that has the Backtrack feature enabled\. The **Backtrack** section doesn't appear for a DB cluster that was created with the Backtrack feature disabled or if the Backtrack feature has been disabled for the DB cluster\.

**To modify backtracking for a DB cluster using the console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. Choose **Databases**\.

1. Choose the cluster that you want to modify, and choose **Modify**\.

1. For **Target Backtrack window**, modify the amount of time that you want to be able to backtrack\. The limit is 72 hours\.  
![\[Modify Backtrack with console\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-backtrack-modify.png)

   The console shows the estimated cost for the amount of time you specified based on the DB cluster's past workload:
   + If backtracking was disabled on the DB cluster, the cost estimate is based on the `VolumeWriteIOPS` metric for the DB cluster in Amazon CloudWatch\.
   + If backtracking was enabled previously on the DB cluster, the cost estimate is based on the `BacktrackChangeRecordsCreationRate` metric for the DB cluster in Amazon CloudWatch\.

1. Choose **Continue**\.

1. For **Scheduling of Modifications**, choose one of the following:
   + **Apply during the next scheduled maintenance window** â Wait to apply the **Target Backtrack window** modification until the next maintenance window\.
   + **Apply immediately** â Apply the **Target Backtrack window** modification as soon as possible\.

1. Choose **Modify cluster**\.

### AWS CLI<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Configuring.CLI"></a>

When you create a new Aurora MySQL DB cluster using the [create\-db\-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-cluster.html) AWS CLI command, backtracking is configured when you specify a `--backtrack-window` value that is greater than zero\. The `--backtrack-window` value specifies the target backtrack window\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](Aurora.CreateInstance.md)\.

You can also specify the `--backtrack-window` value using the following AWS CLI commands:
+  [modify\-db\-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.html) 
+  [restore\-db\-cluster\-from\-s3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-cluster-from-s3.html) 
+  [restore\-db\-cluster\-from\-snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-cluster-from-snapshot.html) 
+  [restore\-db\-cluster\-to\-point\-in\-time](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/restore-db-cluster-to-point-in-time.html) 

The following procedure describes how to modify the target backtrack window for a DB cluster using the AWS CLI\.

**To modify the target backtrack window for a DB cluster using the AWS CLI**
+ Call the [modify\-db\-cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/modify-db-cluster.html) AWS CLI command and supply the following values:
  + `--db-cluster-identifier` â The name of the DB cluster\.
  + `--backtrack-window` â The maximum number of seconds that you want to be able to backtrack the DB cluster\.

  The following example sets the target backtrack window for `sample-cluster` to one day \(86,400 seconds\)\.

  For Linux, macOS, or Unix:

  ```
  aws rds modify-db-cluster \
      --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster \
      --backtrack-window 86400
  ```

  For Windows:

  ```
  aws rds modify-db-cluster ^
      --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster ^
      --backtrack-window 86400
  ```

**Note**  
Currently, you can enable backtracking only for a DB cluster that was created with the Backtrack feature enabled\.

### RDS API<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Configuring.API"></a>

When you create a new Aurora MySQL DB cluster using the [CreateDBCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBCluster.html) Amazon RDS API operation, backtracking is configured when you specify a `BacktrackWindow` value that is greater than zero\. The `BacktrackWindow` value specifies the target backtrack window for the DB cluster specified in the `DBClusterIdentifier` value\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster](Aurora.CreateInstance.md)\.

You can also specify the `BacktrackWindow` value using the following API operations:
+  [ModifyDBCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyDBCluster.html) 
+  [RestoreDBClusterFromS3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RestoreDBClusterFromS3.html) 
+  [RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot.html) 
+  [RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime.html) 

**Note**  
Currently, you can enable backtracking only for a DB cluster that was created with the Backtrack feature enabled\.

## Performing a backtrack<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Performing"></a>

You can backtrack a DB cluster to a specified backtrack time stamp\. If the backtrack time stamp isn't earlier than the earliest possible backtrack time, and isn't in the future, the DB cluster is backtracked to that time stamp\. 

Otherwise, an error typically occurs\. Also, if you try to backtrack a DB cluster for which binary logging is enabled, an error typically occurs unless you've chosen to force the backtrack to occur\. Forcing a backtrack to occur can interfere with other operations that use binary logging\.

**Important**  
Backtracking doesn't generate binlog entries for the changes that it makes\. If you have binary logging enabled for the DB cluster, backtracking might not be compatible with your binlog implementation\.

**Note**  
For database clones, you can't backtrack the DB cluster earlier than the date and time when the clone was created\. For more information about database cloning, see [Cloning a volume for an Aurora DB cluster](Aurora.Managing.Clone.md)\.

## Monitoring backtracking<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Monitoring"></a>

You can view backtracking information and monitor backtracking metrics for a DB cluster\.

### Console<a name="AuroraMySQL.Managing.Backtrack.Describing.Console"></a>

**To view backtracking information and monitor backtracking metrics using the console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/)\.

1. Choose **Databases**\.

1. Choose the DB cluster name to open information about it\.

   The backtrack information is in the **Backtrack** section\.  
![\[Backtrack details for a DB cluster\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-backtrack-details.png)

   When backtracking is enabled, the following information is available:
   + **Target window** â The current amount of time specified for the target backtrack window\. The target is the maximum amount of time that you can backtrack if there is sufficient storage\.
   + **Actual window** â The actual amount of time you can backtrack, which can be smaller than the target backtrack window\. The actual backtrack window is based on your workload and the storage available for retaining backtrack change records\.
   + **Earliest backtrack time** â The earliest possible backtrack time for the DB cluster\. You can't backtrack the DB cluster to a time before the displayed time\.

1. Do the following to view backtracking metrics for the DB cluster:

   1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**\.

   1. Choose the name of the primary instance for the DB cluster to display its details\.

   1. In the **CloudWatch** section, type **Backtrack** into the **CloudWatch** box to show only the Backtrack metrics\.  
![\[Backtrack metrics\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/aurora-backtrack-metrics.png)

      The following metrics are displayed:
      + **Backtrack Change Records Creation Rate \(Count\)** â This metric shows the number of backtrack change records created over five minutes for your DB cluster\. You can use this metric to estimate the backtrack cost for your target backtrack window\.
      + **\[Billed\] Backtrack Change Records Stored \(Count\)** â This metric shows the actual number of backtrack change records used by your DB cluster\.
      + **Backtrack Window Actual \(Minutes\)** â This metric shows whether there is a difference between the target backtrack window and the actual backtrack window\. For example, if your target backtrack window is 2 hours \(120 minutes\), and this metric shows that the actual backtrack window is 100 minutes, then the actual backtrack window is smaller than the target\.
      + **Backtrack Window Alert \(Count\)** â This metric shows how often the actual backtrack window is smaller than the target backtrack window for a given period of time\.
**Note**  
The following metrics might lag behind the current time:  
**Backtrack Change Records Creation Rate \(Count\)**
**\[Billed\] Backtrack Change Records Stored \(Count\)**
